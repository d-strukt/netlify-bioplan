Why? At first I thought it was because I felt that the scenes and genres that I was following were sort of going around in circles, directionless; that maybe the lack of apparent collective movement, of an overarching narrative in music had started to bore me. Maybe. But I think the likelier reason was that I had simply reached a point of satiety with music, no doubt a result of listening to too much of it.\n\nI hadn't abandoned it completely though. And I think I'm starting to fall back into my usual listening habits.\n\nAnyways, this is some of what I've been enjoying these last few weeks.\n\nToasty!  Toastyboy! Very little is know of him, a faceless producer of which little is known. A practitioner of the 2000s' breakstep sound, he made some noise with his releases on Scuba's Hotflush label, back when Scuba was part of the dubstep/140 bpm scene. Toasty's (Damien Russell according to [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/242531-Toasty)) music is very dear to me, mainly because it was one of my points of entry into the world of electronic music and UK rave, 10 years ago. But even then, it was clear to me that his production had a feel of its own, a mix of cinematic sensibilities from 90s electronica and idm, old school dark d'n'b rollers and garridge swing.\n\nHe had disappeared for the larger part of this decade, until his comeback in 2017 with his _Metal_ EP released on Circadian Rhythm's label. “Rebar”, dark and ethereal, instantly became one of my faves from that year.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Rebar\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bpTMLmHXE7k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n“Rebar” came out almost a decade after his previous official release, _On Something / You're Special_, brought to us by Slaughter Mob's Halo Beats label and, breaking away from the breaks sound and taking rhythmic influences from Mala, a delightful dubbier side to his music. Ben UFO was probably creaming himself all over this back then.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty / Toastyboy - On Something\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMTrdAJEhP8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nBut it's his halfstep banger from 2004, “Knowledge”, with which he left his mark. It's certainly his most direct track, adding his own twist to 90s diva and chipmunk vocals. But that snare, that glorious snare, is probably the most mid-2000s sound you'll hear today.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Knowledge\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-pLVMQxS54\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nAfter another two years of silence following _Metal_, Toasty came out of hiding again, back in April,  by opening his own Bandcamp page (as is usual these days) and posting mastered versions of previously-unreleased tracks. No surprises really, in terms of sound, but they definitely warrant a listen.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Unconcious\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3974819469/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://toasty.bandcamp.com/track/unconcious\">unconcious by toasty</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Strangedays\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2436096026/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://toasty.bandcamp.com/track/strangedays\">strangedays by toasty</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Some Kind of Noise\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=385540344/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://toasty.bandcamp.com/track/some-kind-of-noise\">some kind of noise by toasty</a></iframe>} />\n\nMore can be listened to on his page: https://toasty.bandcamp.com/\n\nBreakstep is evidently the forgotten sister genre of the other two “140 bpm” genres, one that I don't know much about unfortunately. It shares some of the same roots as dubstep and, if it never drew much attention, it has to be because, at the end of the day, it was probably the most conservative of the three genres (the other being grime, of course).  When people speak and write about hearing dubstep for the first time in 2005-6 (thank you forums and archived blog posts), they almost always mention how they were very aware that they were listening to something new, something fresh. Breakstep was ultimately too stuck in the 90s. “Slowed-down drum n bass” is not an unfair descriptor. Nevertheless, there was some quality shit.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Elemental - 925\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KushotpeDlM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Quiet Storm (aka Caspa) - Tribute 10\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmUG6MAvOR4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Darqwan (aka Oris Jay) - Said the Spider\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HagDGlTCpWc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n♪\n\nContinuing on the theme of previously unreleased tracks showing up on Bandcamp this year, how about Lux Groove's “Five Four”? Current and former fans of DJ Youngsta might not recognize that name, but they might recognize the Swamp 81-styled drum machine bass jam that was part of Yunx' “130 sound” sets of 2013-2015. I don't remember in which interview he says this, but I do remember him mentioning how certain “130 sound” (i.e. techno and electro post-dubstep/UK bass hybrids) tracks reminded him of early dubstep. This is an example of such a track, showing up of the self-released [_Collections_](https://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections) __compilation. It's a slick track, stripped-back, with a rolling, cascading bass. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Lux Groove - Five Four\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2227437386/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2304879424/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections\">Collections by Lux Groove</a></iframe>} />\n\nIt reminds me in a way of Benga's early, early production. Like this little number:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Benga - Star Wars (Hatcha Dub)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hn1ZAlcXZrQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nAnd this unreleased one:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Benga - Skank VIP (Youngsta dubplate)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bh73nZqYmE?start=107\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nThere's more of these skeletal drum machine tracks in Lux Groove's release:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Lux Groove - Know You\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2227437386/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1857208060/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections\">Collections by Lux Groove</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Lux Groove - Seven\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2227437386/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1884250366/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections\">Collections by Lux Groove</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nWhere I'm currently residing, summer had come in full swing. These days, that means that we've just had to go through weeks of burning sunlight and sticky, humid air with some rain to bring people here some relief. Maybe like how some people tend to listen to more emo, Nick Drake or Radiohead during the fall, or to more extreme metal during the long winter nights, I think the recent weather drew me to Archie B's _Steppin Up Vol 1_ mix. Yeah, I know that deep tech's come and gone since a while now, but somehow his so-glossy-as-to-be-aquatic sound somehow seemed a fitting soundtrack for these few weeks.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Archie B - Steppin Up - Vol 1\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156643158&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd if you need more deep tech goodness, I recommend giving a listen to this mix of Dean Allen (of Studio 37) productions:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dean Allen (Studio 37) Tribute Mix - Compiled By: Theo 'Stretch' Lewis\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244798192&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nHis cold, nocturnal and skeletal beats a great contrast to Archie B's work:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Archie B - Give My All\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pV9u6_d06E\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Studio 37 - Warpath [Dean Allen production]\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PpUL8Ymed2Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />","name":"20190809_getting-back-into-the-swing-of-things","urlPath":"/article/20190809_getting-back-into-the-swing-of-things"},{"publicationDate":"May 18, 2019","title":"Imperial Selection","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/title-image-feast.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"Some quick thoughts, and going through my fave mixes and sets from the past few weeks.","body":"I don't know what happened. I don't know if everyone was particularly inspired during these past few weeks or that maybe I was particularly receptive, but a lot of damn good mixes and sets came out, and it's the first time I've cut some out. I meant to make this list a week before, but I got too caught up doing the D1 thing, which turned out to be longer than I had initially anticipated. \n\nI honestly don't have much commentary to make for this entry. As much good music as there was since my last list, there wasn't anything that came to mind as to the direction the music is going (or the lack thereof in this web 2.0-era of music experience). All I can say is: as we draw closer to the end of another decade, I've come to terms with the fact that we didn't witness the birth of a “big” new genre that would seem to captivate everyone at once. There's too much music-discovery-as-personal-experience, too much looking back, too much choice at any given moment for it to happen in electronic music right now\n\nWave? Future Bass? Gqom? Deconstructed Club? The latter has been using too many samples of movie effects and shattered drinking glasses, and become too _auteur­_-iste to be taken seriously outside of the “music geek”-sphere. (You need to attract the “non-artists”, the “anti-artist”, to drive in that heavy surge of “innocent” creativity, not just from the artsy crowd). Wave seemed incredibly uninspired the moment it was invented (in my experience, that would be around 2012-3; basically an offshoot of the dullest trap-influenced grime beats that Plastician was playing on his Rinse show at the time), but I've noticed that it's slowly (see:slowly) been picking up steam. The gqom originators have watered down their sound since the likes of mixmag accepted them into their ranks. That isn't intrinsically bad (in fact, I love some of the new stuff), but this has resulted in it being sucked into the global blob of afro/global bass/club  in the general consciousness.\n\nAnd what about juke? Well, I really like it, and I like that it's gotten a resurgence of interest lately with the “160” scene, but it didn't end up causing the disruption I hoped it would back in 2010.\n\nYep, this really was hip hop's decade. Hip hop is what gave us something close to \"new, visceral music as a collective experience”, starting with the whole mixtape-era of Atlanta trap and Chicago drill (and bop, to an extent), and going into the Future and Young Thug sound of autotuned alien-gangster stuff.  Kendrick Lamar's _To Pimp a Butterfly_ is probably the only album in these 10 years that has brought together an intersection of geeks, casual listeners, old hip hop heads and younger ones (Kanye's _Fantasy_ too, maybe). And some have been saying that UK drill is the genre currently channeling the energy of old school hardcore and jungle'(as opposed to the UK techno/bass and deconstructed club stuff).\n\nOk, maybe I had a thing or two to say. I'll stop there. \n\nDespite all this, the quality is still there. And this is what I think was the most exciting in mixes and sets since my last list. I'll start things off with the three must-listens.\n\nFirstly, a mix from March that I had missed. I would like to confirm that yes, DJ Stingray's Essential Mix is just as good as people have been saying. One of Europe's current Detroit ambassadors gives us essentially two hours of electro and techno slappers, showing us that there's still some goddamn funk left in Berlin. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Stingray - BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix (02-03-2019)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmjniDKIA1Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nFor some more dirty electro bidness, Galaxian, one of Stingray's past collaborators, gave the Hong Kong Community Radio a hell of a set - an intergalactic blast, a cosmic fuckfest, apocalypse-as-enlightenment, bass designed to mess up your insides. (check out his [incredible release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71k8xhbSUL4) from this year)\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Galaxian - 19/4/2019 (HKCR)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FHKCR%2Fgalaxian-1942019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nTo switch things up a bit (but not dial down in energy), Akito and Noire's set for NTS Radio in April. The Sans Absence label boss Akito, based in London, is doing everything right with his “percussively-focused club music” - or  “hard drum” as some might call. Or maybe “turbo funky” as I'd call it (stealing Fracture's “turbo dnb” term). I don't know what it's called, but this heavy, rave-y carnaval sound will make you want to slap ya mom up. Well, I'm mostly just glad that I'm getting into a new UK sound that has stepped out of the “dubstep synthesis” of UK bass, and that isn't treading water.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Akito - 5th April 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fakito-5th-april-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nSpeaking of “dubstep synthesis”, Henry Greenleaf's mix for Body Promise deserves an honorable mention amongst the previous three. While his peers are going more into leftfield or conventional-techno territories, the former dnb producer is holding it down with his style of UK techno that sometimes veers close to techno-via-hatcha-circa-2004. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf – Body Promise BP 118\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/602717451&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nFor more of those UK techno vibes, the Famous Eno collaborator from Mexico, Siete Catorce, has also done a mix for JEROME mixfiles on soundcloud. (https://soundcloud.com/jeromemixfileseries/jerome-mixfile-425-siete-catorce )\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nNow for some dnb/jungle.\n\nRupture London took over Keep Hush at the very end of March. The label has been repping the classic dark rollage dnb sound since its inception, and the Youtube channel has recreated the underground vibes that Boiler Room initially had 10 years ago. The pairing has resulted in incredible sets from Mantra and Mani Festo, both of them effortlessly bringing together the old and the new.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mantra DJ set | Keep Hush Live: Rupture Takeover\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIaL7xi_MAM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mani Festo DJ set | Keep Hush Live: Rupture Takeover\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-TF41HePaI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nFor more dark rollage, check out Dom & Roland intense 30-min mix for BBC Radio 1. It's essentially a  promo for his bandcamp page, so check it (https://domandroland.bandcamp.com/ ) out if you can. His new release from April is great – smooth yet heavy. (https://domandroland.bandcamp.com/album/beach-bum-dred-sound )\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dom & Roland BBC Radio 1 Guest Mix April 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/603350553&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nKeysound did an “All Vinyl ('94-'98 D&B)” set for their monthly show on Rinse. Expect the classic names like Photek, Doc Scott, Ed Rush & Optical and Krust. (https://soundcloud.com/rinsefm/keysound-25th-april-2019 )\n\n//\n\nSonic Rampage's Pearsall also did a great mix of new school old school, this time focusing on new tracks from artists that imitate the old “darkside” breakbeat and jungle vibe from '93. And he's shared some [great thoughts](http://sonicrampage.org/blog/2019/04/pearsall-presents-get-it-005-get-dark-new-skool-darkside-mix/) on this current retro-rave trend, as well as some [interesting discussion](http://sonicrampage.org/blog/2019/05/more-thoughts-on-get-dark/) from readers/listeners. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Pearsall presents Get It 005: Get Dark\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/610333344&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nAnd lastly, for some new new school, definitely check out some “160” stuff that I mentioned, blending halftime, juke and jungle. London-based and Reprezent Radio resident Sherelle has been leading the charge on that front. And she invites Om Unit to provide a guest mix for his take on the sound.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Sherelle W/ Om Unit | 16th April 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FReprezent%2Fsherelle-w-om-unit-16th-april-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nAnd lastly lastly, Benny Ill shared a 2 hour-long session of 90s garage  (_garridge_ and _guhrahje_) through his twitter page to celebrate the coming of Spring. I was kind enough to download from his mediafire link and upload on mixcloud, so get this into your system, pronto.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"BENNY ILL'S GARAGE SPECIAL\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2Fmordak%2Fbenny-ills-garage-special%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />","name":"20190519_imperial-selection","urlPath":"/article/20190519_imperial-selection"},{"publicationDate":"Apr 16, 2019","title":"It's All About Bass and Drums Still, Isn't? (+ March mixes and sets)","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/titleimage-1-.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"A short reflection on the tendencies of modern underground electronic club music with my recommended mixes and sets from March in the spirit of that reflection.","body":"One of the things that has defined underground club music during this decade (which is now coming to a close) is the almost complete deconstruction of its chronology.  I've somewhat already touched upon this on some [past](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_the-past-is-now-the-future-was-then) [entries](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181126_hardcore-will-never-die); but to briefly reiterate: the “new” (the “innovative”, the \"fresh\", the “future”, the “unknown”) is no longer the sole object of fixation; the “good” simply suffices. \n\nThe instant accessibility of 40 years of electronic club music has been a reality for the past 10+ years. DJs, producers and listeners (and not just the geekiest of them anymore) are now more and more aware of its history, digging deeper and deeper to see what can be discovered and rediscovered, introduced and brought back to life, imitated and reinterpreted, etc.\n\nEverything and anything can be new now. Young DJs making a living out of playing old boogie records isn't weird. In fact, you can probably book one for your house or techno night, and not many people will bat an eye. I don't know how many times I've heard a track on a set, thinking it was new, only to find out later that it had come out 25 years ago – and vice versa.\n\nThis thought came into my back during the mesmerizing first hour of Josey Rebelle's set in Toronto back in February – a completely obvious fact as to be almost laughably : for all the stylistic flourishes that club music has gone through in the past three decades or so, the backbone has always been, well, bass and drums (not to say “drum and bass”). That is what ties it all together.  Josey Rebelle seems to take that to heart; her set in Toronto consisted of stripped-back beats from these last three decades, mixing a breakbeat techno track into a minimalist UK funky track into an old school Chicago drum machine, hand-clap jam into a weighty, modern UK techno track (à la Kaizen) - all of it ready to make the bass bins burst into flames. It was her careful selection that made it seem like,  despite all of these tracks' different origins, in the end, it's all the same thing, and it all congealed into a cohesive-yet-varied sound.\n\nThose are the kind of DJs that are my favourites: the ones that have a particular vision, the ones who aim to achieve a particular sound or vibe, while taking music from different places (and now, from different eras). It's like how Ben UFO used to do back in the early part of this decade, mixing techno with carefully selected grime and dubstep tracks, underlining the similarities these seemingly disparate genres might have. Much more interesting than the DJs that just go through the Drumcode and Planet Rhythm catalogs, or the genre-hopping DJs with a severe lack of focus and no vision.\n\nInadvertently, this ended up being the underlying theme for most of my mixes selection for the month of March: _It's All About Bass and Drums Still, Isn't?_ I've always leaned towards the more stripped-back, “groove-based” side of club music, whether in house, dubstep or dnb, and these mixes really reflect that. They mostly consist of new “new” music (which I actively look for nowadays), mostly drawing from fresher styles of underground club music. As such, none of them really adhere to a genre, but each strive to reach a vibe showing how they interpret \"deep\", \"rude\", \"heavy\" electronic club music somewhat rooted in (or influenced by) UK sound system culture (hardcore, dnb, jungle, dubstep, etc).\n\n**Anna Morgan**'s ravey mix of hard drum, subby UK techno, new wave breakbeat techno (including a great remix of Mr Vegas' “Head High”) and weird 4x4 techno tracks from the likes of Object Blue and Quest?onmarc makes for a thrilling listen. **Shampain **keeps it ravey as well with his set on Noods Radio which ranges from leftfield, bright electro and 4x4 weighty stompers (including an awesome hard dance remix of Destiny Child's “Lose My Breath”). **Deena Abdelwahed **also leans close to UK techno sounds, but hones into a more “tribal”/oriental vibe, if you will. **Chants **takes that tribal vibe further into global bass and hard drum territory that would sure make the Nervous Horizon members grin like idiots. **Henry Greenleaf** does his own take on UK techno, influenced by old school dubstep's dubby vibes and Swamp 81's trippier subbass excursions. Toronto's **Ciel **goes into stripped-back and bassy (and sometimes heavy) underground house, techno and electro vibes for the city's new ISO Radio, including fresh tracks from great new producers like Nite Fleit, Klein Zage, Lauren Flax (her “Work Dat” has really been making the rounds, eh?) and herself. Following his big Keep Hush set, Manchester's **Strategy **has been on people's radars and he joins Chunky for his birthday special on NTS Radio to offer one hour of his own new, unreleased material: a concoction of funky, deep tech, old XXXY-like tracks, electro and Swamp 81-approved beats. Finally, **DJ Booga** from Germany offers a set of the modern, deeper ends of everything dnb (two-steppers, halftime, juke-inspired, dark atmopheric, etc, etc).\n\nThere you have it: eight great mixes and sets from March of new, groove-based ravey goodness. And a **DJ Katapila** set of Afrobeats and Afropop to top it off. His releases on Awesome Tapes From Africa are kind of shit to be honest, but he's a fine selector.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Anna Morgan - Kaizen Show 28th March 2019 (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fthe-kaizen-show-w-madam-x-28th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"LEFT\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\n**\\*\\*HER SET STARTS AT AROUND 01:02:00\\*\\***\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Shampain- 12th March 2019 (Noods Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fshampain-12th-march-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Deena Abdelwahed - 14th March 2019 (Rinse FM)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/590333844&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Chants - JEROME Mixfile #420\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/588622329&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf - Fresh Kicks97\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/590537442&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ciel - 8th March 2019 (ISO Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FISORadio%2Finternational-womens-day-ciel-8th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Strategy - Chunky's Birthday Special 17th March (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fchunky-17th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n\\*\\*HIS SET STARTS AT AROUND 00:30:40\\*\\*\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Booga - DLPC #033\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/589365975&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Katapila - 12th March 2019 (Noods Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fdj-katapila-12th-march-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />","name":"20190417_its-all-about-bass-and-drums-still-isnt","urlPath":"/article/20190417_its-all-about-bass-and-drums-still-isnt"},{"publicationDate":"Mar 19, 2019","title":"Future Bits and Pieces","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/cs702073-01a-big.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"I've go advanced promo copies now, so I go through some upcoming stuff and some unreleased material to see what's on the horizon","body":"Well, I've become my own worst enemy; I'm officially writing reviews for a magazine. In my case case, I've joined the writing team for the \"Frequencies\" section (or \"dance & electronic\" as they otherwise put it) of Exclaim. It's not so much for my prowess in writing (I think), as it is for the fact that I \"look like I know my stuff\". They must be unaware that there are thousands of people on discogs and soundcloud with an infinite amount of knowledge about electronic music, much more than I could hope to achieve in the next, say, 10 years? I take it that my penchant for writing about music already on this blog made me an appealing addition to their team, which was apparently lacking in writers.\n\nWhich means that, now, I have to write about one review a week, for releases of my choosing, without crossing the 300 word limit by too much. So for those roughly 300 words a week, I'm given what is probably the greatest perk in being a reviewer: getting my hands on future records (digital format, of course), sometimes well before their release dates (months, for example).\n\nThat was the case for the inaugural V/A EP of a new Toronto-based label, Parallel Minds, for which I had to write a review at the beginning of February. The EP consists of 4 tracks from Toronto producers: the relatively unknowns Yohei S., Radiant Aura Faculty (aka Raf Reza) and Daniel 58, lead by Ciel, whom you might know from her release Shanti Celeste's Peach Discs label. Her \"Hind Sight is 360\" here, an energetic and dreamy deep house track with 90s Moby vibes, is tied with this year's remix of Ilana Bryne's \"Mmm Mmm Mmm\" for being by far her best work yet. The rest is really solid as well. Listen to samples [here](https://soundcloud.com/weareparallelminds/parallel-minds-vol-1-various-artists?in=cl_lit/sets/parallel-minds-vol-1). It comes out on April 12th (iirc) so my review should be up around that time. \n\nComing out this Friday, which I also reviewed, is Dead Man Chest's new record on Sneaker Social Club. He calls up his \"new school\" old school junglist peeps Sonic, Response and Coco Bryce for some collabs. The Response one is the best of the bunch, unsurprisingly. Last year, Response & Pilkin showed us with their \"Plastic Face / Tangled Up\" that there's still some legs to 150bpm ethereal four-on-the-floor jungle beats à la Dreamscape circa 93. DMC and Response revisit that idea with their \"We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes\".  DMC also explores that sound with the Sonic [collab](https://soundcloud.com/sneakersocialclub/dead-mans-chest-x-sonic-pum-flex-ra-tracks), though to slightly lesser effect. \n\nSpeaking of Sonic, go peep his new LP, _110174, on _Western Lore._ _It beautifully bridges the gap between old school sounds and new school d'n'b (i.e. more \"techy\", sometimes \"ghetto bass-influenced\"). There's some great 150-160bpm 4x4 d'n'b in there, as well as straight up revivalism stuff like \"Empty Bar\". Bristol's Western Lore continues its hot streak.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\" Sonic - Empty Bar (Western Lore)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/570099861&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd speaking about four-on-the-floor d'n'b, how 'bout we get on with the promos I've received for upcoming releases that I feel are worth mentioning. How about Fracture's _Big Up the Ladies EP_? Its titular track also does some old school/new school gap-bridging (...), starting with old school rave chords. and then dropping into a 4x4 beat with ragga vocal samples and breaks while having that \"techy\", \"twitchy\" modern feel. The rest of the release follows suit in this new \"turbo\" sound, as he's dubbed it (not joking). Although he did it much better with last year's \"Turbo Toms\", this is still solid. It comes out the 12th of April on the forward thinking club-focused Astrophonica. \"Big Up the Ladies\" has been made available.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Fracture - Big Up The Ladies\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=245406130/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://fracture.bandcamp.com/album/big-up-the-ladies\">Big Up The Ladies by Fracture</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Fracture - Turbo Toms\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1410055085/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2187643463/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://exitrecordsuk.bandcamp.com/album/exit081-fracture-soundboy-get-nervous-ep\">EXIT081 - Fracture - &#39;Soundboy Get Nervous&#39; EP by Fracture</a></iframe>} />\n\nSo it seems like four-on-the-flour jungle/d'n'b might be a thing now, or in the near-future? If it is, I'm expecting it to get swallowed up by the juke/trap/ghetto-inspired d'n'b DJs like Sinistarr, Valerie Molano and A.Fruits. Should be good. \n\nOn a more laid-back vibe is another label inauguration - Berlin's Sensible Seelen - with a collab by the label's founders DJ Kusse and Khshathra. DJ Kusse is actually one half of Hi & Saberhagen, whose _Light on Leaves_ from last year was a great idm-ish minimal deep house treat. On _Sensible Seelen Vol. 1, _the Berliners go for a late-night, headphones-listening kind of vibe with contemplative, melancholic house. The opener \"Into Your Soul\" sets the tone as a jazzy downtempo number. I'm not usually into this kind of stuff, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Samo DJ and Karima F round it out with a remixes, the latter one offering something that resembles 90s' Smith & Mighty. [Snippets ](https://soundcloud.com/sensibleseelen/sensible-seelen-vol-1-snippets)are available. It comes out on the 29th of this month.\n\nFor some \"dancefloor fodder\", keep an eye out for Ejeca's new release on Unknown to the Unknown for the label's Dance Trax series, where they place their more direct and high-energy stuff. The opener \"Gilboa\" sounds like something that Peverelist would come up with if he was forced to do some 4x4 big room techno, mainly due to the main melody; or, to be more precise, like a Peverelist and Roberto collab. I could do without the Truncate remix, but it's not offensive. Snippets are available on [Juno](https://www.juno.co.uk/products/ejeca-dance-trax-vol-18/718899-01/). It comes out sometime in April according to the promo.\n\nLastly, Gary Gritness's upcoming LP, _The Legend of Cherenkov Blue, _on the Hypercolour label is about to be my first reviewed 9/10. Gritness has made it his mission to keep that ol' school funk sound alive in his electro style. The album continues in that vein, ranging from Dam Funk-esque jams to Underground Resistance-styled techno at its \"frenziest\", to Drexciya-inspired electro - all with the melodic sensibilities of retro video games. According to the promo, there's a narrative thread to the whole album, but apart for some vocal samples, it's all instrumental, so I don't care much for it. All I know is that it's a ~~g~~ood fucking time, much better than what the mighty Morphology have been cooking up these last couple of years. The album comes out on the 19th of April, so my review will be up around that time.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Gary Gritness - The Legend of Cherenkov Blue (SNIPPETS)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/582692388&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n## The fresh smell of acetate\n\nOn to the unreleased tracks that I've just started to collect on my Youtube profile. I've done so just to have an easy way to listen to these great tracks without having to load up the mixes. Also, because I have mad respect for people that do it for, say, dubstep tracks, without whom I would never have known about certain music (all the early DMZ, Skream and Benga unreleased tracks that are amazing).\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Koehler - Winged\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0z9uWqO6Ieg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nI heard this on Koehler's [Groove podcast mix](https://groove.de/2019/01/11/koehler-groove-podcast-193/) from January and it blew me away instantly. Koehler is a producer whom I've always felt could make better music, even if I enjoy his stuff on Skudge and Berceuse Heroique, and even if _Oblivious Pool_ was one of my favourite releases from 2017. Well, with \"Winged\", he's answered my wish. To me, \"Winged\" is the perfect embodiment of what \"_keeping the spirit of hardcore and rave_\" means. Without resorting to retroism or revivalism (or nostalgia), he's able to conjure up the euphoria of past rave music, better than the jungle revivalists, better than the hardcore revivalists and better than the house producers currently using amen breaks (again...).  Will this get a release? Who knows...\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Impey - Conquest Mode\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4sU1LJvl4s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nI love Peverelist's work, and I love the music that he's pushed on his labels, but I can't help but feel like he's been in a creative rut for about a year,  despite the consistent quality of his mixes and output from both him and his \"crew\". On his and Kowton's Livity Sound show of February on NTS Radio, they freshened things up a bit by dropping the tempo to about 110bpm for the majority of the episode, leading them to drop this, Impey's \"Conquest Mode\".  Something different for both the grime producer and techno/bass DJs . Am I crazy, or is this almost on some hyphy tip? Leftfield dubby hyphy, maybe? Anyways, I like this direction, and I've also been enjoying the recent bass music of 90-110 bpm that's been coming out these last couple of years. Even Loefah has be dabbling in some 100-110bpm stuff. It's like he says to Youngsta on their Heavyweight LDN interview a couple of months ago, \"_I feel like there needs to be something fresh right now. It's time for something fresh_.\" Will the slower tempos lead to further things? We can only wait and see, really.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Cyclist – Inhale Exhale (Bruce’s Deep Breath Mix) (dubplate)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zs3lGFakW_Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nHow about this remix from UK's Bruce? To be honest, I haven't been following him for about a year and a half ever since his whole \"contemplative, emotional dance music\" phase (which means that, yes, I still haven't listened to his album from last year). But this track, taken from Hodge's Groove Podcast mix from February, makes me regret not doing so. I like the sparsity of the production, the skeletal, metallic hi-hats, the heavy kicks that punctuate the first beats and a great use of electric guitar samples. It's atmospheric, in a way, but it has some rhythmic edge to it, you know?\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"AceMo & J.

AceMo has been making some noise this past year, following his release on the Michigan label Vanity Press and his _All My Life_ collection of tracks from this year. This still-untitled J. Albert collab is the best stuff I've heard from him yet. Beautiful sparse-but-effective synthwork here. A great, steady groove with melodic, melancholic atmospherics. Now, to find out more about this J. Albert fella...","name":"20190320_future-bits-and-pieces","urlPath":"/article/20190320_future-bits-and-pieces"},{"publicationDate":"Jan 18, 2019","title":"Kraftwerk - Music Endless","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/title-image-1.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"Kraftwerk are considered as the forefathers of current electronic music. We go through some works that contain some of the German group's musical elements.","body":"Confession: about two months ago, I wasn't familiar with Kraftwerk's discography. This is almost heresy, I know.  As someone who writes about electronic music, my unfamiliarity with them is a more than noticeable gap in my knowledge of its history. Kraftwerk's music is widely considered an important building block for all things electronic, from Synthpop, to Techno, to IDM, to Hip hop, to Electro – and beyond. Its DNA weaves itself into all these different styles and genres. And it's on that last point that I would like to expand. \n\n10 years ago, Kraftwerk's music came into the spotlight for a moment, due to the heavily promoted remastered re-releases of their classic albums (_Autobahn_ ('74), _Radio-Activity_ ('75), _Trans-Europe Express_ ('77), _The Man Machine _('78), _Computer World_ ('81)). And although they had piqued my interest, enough to listen to a couple of tracks, for some reason I never bothered to further look into them. Really, I was just too focused on listening to new music. But finally, after nearly a decade, they showed up again as my friend asked that we listen to _Computer World_ as background music when we were hanging out. And right off the bat, what jumped at me was how familiar their music actually sounded. Even more so, when that first listen prompted me to go trough their mentioned classic albums.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/cover-coll-1-.jpg)\n\nSpotting musical influences and lineages can be a tricky thing to do, because influences can be both direct and indirect. Sometimes you can tell, just by listening, that an artist is trying to imitate someone else's music, or trying to mix together those of their contemporaries or predecessors. Sometimes influences become clear only when an artist mentions them. And there are times when an artist's music recalls past works, scenes, or genres _without them actually knowing said works, scenes or genres_.  That's because every music piece is comprised of various bits and pieces of musical elements and ideas that are passed on from people to people, generation to generation. As Simon Reynolds once put it: “_Everything is a remix_.” Kraftwerk is considered as one of the most important groups in contemporary music. Probably more so now, with electronic music becoming extremely prominent (EDM, Hip Hop, RnB, etc, etc). The reach of their influence is almost immeasurable.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Numbers\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YPiCeLwh5o\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nConsider an obvious example of Kraftwerk-influenced music, in Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force's “Planet Rock”, from New York, released a year after _Computer World_. Following the producer's, Arthur Baker, idea for a new song, Bambaataa samples two songs from the German group: _Trans-Europe Express_' titular track, and _Computer World_'s “Numbers”; using the synth work from the former and the beat pattern from the latter. Added on top is some old school rapping,  call and response vocals, and a robotic voice singing “_Rock, rock, the planet rock. Don't stop_”. This results in an early, Electro-styled Hip Hop party anthem.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force - Planet Rock\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9J3lwZjHenA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nThe old school Hip Hop and Kraftwerk connection is a natural one, as the latter have expressed their love for American RnB (and Funk, notably James Brown), and that they consciously incorporated some of its beats. “Planet Rock” is a great example of how seamlessly they fuse together. \n\nBut the Germans' biggest mark on American electronic music has to be on Detroit. With the city's industrial peak still fresh in its residents' memory (leaving them fascinated with technology) and with a healthy dose of Funk, Post-Punk and German electronic music, Motor City became the birthplace of Electro and Techno (cousin genres). I come back to the famous quote from Techno pioneer Derrick May in describing the old Detroit sound: “_...like if George Clinton _\\[of Funk group, Parliament]_ and Kraftwerk were caught in an elevator, with only a sequencer to keep them company_.” And if that scenario would ever happen, maybe the results would sound something like Cybotron's 1983 single, “Clear”. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Cybotron - Clear\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fGqiBFqWCTU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"(to compare) Kraftwerk - Computer World 2 \" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuuR9hL4pgM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nThe 90s saw a 2nd wave of Detroit producers influenced by the “Belleville Three”, the Techno and Electro originators – Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson and Juan Atkins. The Electro/Techno Duo Drexciya explored this sound further. The titles of their tracks and releases evoke an imaginary, futuristic, underwater society. One of them, “Aquabahn”, references the title of Kraftwerk's most known piece, “Autobahn”. But their music already hints at a Kraftwerk connection. Listen to their “Wavejumper” track, from their 1995 EP release, _Aquatic Invasion_: a funked-out, sped-up, Kraftwerk-esque jam.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Drexciya - Wavejumper\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2M1S_4fW_JE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nRecently, maybe because of Techno fatigue seeping in, Electro has shown up again on people's radar – and mine also. One of my favourite current producers in the genre is the Glasgow-based Galaxian. If Kraftwerk were optimistic futurists, reconciling Nature and Technology, Man and Machine, Galaxian goes the other way, evoking a dystopian, maybe even apocalyptic, future. The producer has never mentioned any affinities for the German group, but the title of his track “From Glasgow to Detroit”, gives us a hint of there being an indirect musical lineage.  As his track “Dosing the Population” shows, some musical resemblances are there: vocals filtered through machines; the cold, thin, repetitive, drum-programming;  an Electro beat pattern; the synth chords; the high-pitched bleeps and bloops. But, of course, if Kraftwerk's music is generally soothing, then Galaxian's is frenzied, pushing the sound to higher speeds (just over 150 bpm) and putting in an overwhelming bass line. Kraftwerk in a chaotic world.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Galaxian - Dosing The Population\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1194402259/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://lowerparts.bandcamp.com/album/dosing-the-population\">Dosing The Population by Galaxian</a></iframe>} />\n\nLet's step away from dance music for a moment. Kraftwerk are also known for being a massive influence on the Synthpop genre, displaying a flair for pop sensibilities, incorporating melodic elements of _Schlager _(a genre of German pop music) into their compositions.  In _The Man Machine_, _Radio-Activity_ and _Computer World_, there are some tracks that can be classified as being “pop songs”. And while their music has definitely influenced 80s artists like Gary Numan, I thought we'd listen to a more recent Synthpop act, Junior Boys. The Canadian duo's 2004 debut release _Exit Boys_, adopts a Kraftwerk-esque  drum-machine percussion and bright analog synths, with a minimalist approach for the arrangements,  and adding their own touch of modern RnB vocals. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Junior Boys - Bellona\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GD0Kktjw7eg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - The Model\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzIY9iiAbfs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nKraftwerk's DNA also finds itself in IDM (“Intelligent Dance Music”; yes, seriously), an umbrella term  for all electronic music taking elements of Techno and Electro, but putting it out of the context of the dance and making music for home-listening, with “more open-ended structures and possibilities”. Although the music can have a beat, IDM is more about creating a mood than a danceable groove, if you will. Last year saw the release of two 7th Plain compilations,  with music in the vein of IDM. And the vibe he establishes in his own work makes me think of Kraftwerk's.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Kometenmelodie 1\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYPILS3jhHQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Metropolis\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXTBGB2cKAk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The 7th Plain - I Think I Think Too Much\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qQdGY1T6eE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The 7th Plain - Reality of Space\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-F4QnvCPyMk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nIf Kraftwerk, following in the footsteps of German and French Electro-Acoustique musicians, would sometimes include re-creations of machine sounds into their music (like at the start of their _Radio-Activity_ album and at the beginning of “Pocket Calculator”), Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda made it his entire aesthetic, aiming to make “glitch” music. His 2005 album [_Dataplex _](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhfZk1llUo)is composed almost entirely of skittering bleeps and bloops, and glitch and machine noises,  all set up in discernible beat patterns. As the album goes on, ambient sounds are also introduced, like in his 10-minute track “data.matrix”. (**\\*\\*Watch out for your ears!\\*\\***)\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ryoji Ikeda - data.matrix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5hhFMSAuf4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nEven before Detroit producers were making Kraftwerk-inspired dance jams, the group's music had already some success on American dance floors, as New York House Djs in the late 70s had “Metal on Metal” in their record bag, with the track being a hit among the clubbers. The track itself is a dubbed out, instrumental version of the track that precedes it, “Trans-Europe Express”. Maybe sensing its club potential, Detroit's Carl Craig would make a re-imagining of it in his “Mind of a Machine”, a deep, four-to-the-floor Techno cut. Curiously, it begins with the sounds of a car being started, maybe in a callback to “Autobahn” (which starts the same way).\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Trans-Europe Express + Metal on Metal\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FaBAU-8JIb8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Carl Craig - Mind of a Machine\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8N8MnQzuGk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nLastly, continuing on that Techno vibe, we'll finish with one of their countrymen, Ben Klock. A resident DJ at Berlin's Berghain (probably one of the most prestigious clubs in the world), Klock became popular at the turn of the decade for his selection of “pure”, “warm” Techno while adding his own mixing flair at the decks. Outside of the American Midwest, the Germans, alongside the British, were the first to “get” Techno, recognizing the 70s German electronic elements it had coded within it. _Berghain 04 _ was the mix CD which introduced me to the DJ. The drum-machine influence is quite apparent, as Klock goes for more “minimalist” tracks; sometimes with washes of white-noise, bleeps and bloops, and machine-manipulated vocal samples; sometimes with repetitious melodic lines and bright synths. The steady beat also recalls Kraftwerk's _motorik_, steady pulse that they had adopted from 70s Krautrock and, as previously mentioned, American RnB and Funk. And, of course, he doesn't forget the Detroit connection, including Rolando's (also from Detroit) “De Cago” which has sampled vocals repeating “_Detroit! Chicago!_”.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ben Klock - Berghain 04\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMNFX1diOwI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />","name":"20190118_kraftwerk-music-endless","urlPath":"/article/20190118_kraftwerk-music-endless"},{"publicationDate":"Nov 26, 2018","title":"The Past is Now : Drum N Bass Edition","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/past160.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"This year has been great for those who like their bass music at high velocities. We go through some great DnB releases, both old school and forward-thinking.","body":"Anyone that has been following underground electronic music has certainly noticed that drum breaks have made a strong comeback these last couple of years, creeping themselves back into House and Techno. The current fascination with old school Jungle and Hardcore (I talk about this in my[ last article](https://patkardenaz.blogspot.com/2018/11/hardcore-will-never-die.html)), has also made me realize how exciting the Jungle/DnB scene has been these last few years, with there being equal parts revivalism and forward thinking momentum. This year has been a wonderful one for the old school heads, and it has shown that there is still some juice left in the old sound. It has also shown that there is equally a healthy dose of experimentation, to see where Jungle and Dnb can go. So I thought I'd give a rundown of some interesting long-form releases that have piqued my interest throughout the year, and that are worth checking out.\n\nEarly 2018 gave us **Street Beats Volume 2**, a compilation of unearthed and previously-unreleased gems from about 1994. The compilation is brought to us by Basement Records, who've dug inside their own vaults to compile it, bringing together legends such as Peshay, Photek (know as Truper at the time), and Source Direct (going by the name Oblivion). The label has been active since about 1991 and has recently shifted its focus towards re-releases of their own old school material, which had been only available on vinyl records. Their sound is one that I'm particularly fond of. The synth work and atmosphere is ethereal and melodic, backed up by a dark and heavy backbone, with the subbass and chaotic breaks manipulation. It's Jungle with remnants of Hardcore.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Peshay & Roger Johnson - Crazy Daydreams (Original Dubplate Mix)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pzI7HyD_lA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"[Unknown Artist] - Street Beats Volume 6AA\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uf64DViMCOA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nNext up we have **Blunted Breaks Vol. 1**, a compilation by Western Lore. The Bristol-based label has only been active for two years, yet it has made a big splash in the scene. Their roster includes some of the biggest names in \"new school\" old school Jungle: Tim Reaper, Coco Bryce, Dead Man's Chest, and Threshold. As the title suggests, they participate in revivalism (Dead Man's Chest covers for his releases on the label recall the old Dreamscape flyers), but they also take it upon themselves to make the old sound new again. And while some tracks go in full retro mode like Coco Bryce's \"Adventures in Perception\" (only betraying itself due to the cleaner modern production), others, like Earl Grey's \"Levitate\", try to offer something that is more fresh. Nevertheless, the music is all good.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Coco Bryce - Adventures In Perception\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=345771353/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2662542525/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://westernlore.bandcamp.com/album/blunted-breaks-vol-1\">Blunted Breaks Vol.1 by Coco Bryce</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Earl Grey - Levitate\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=345771353/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3616042508/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://westernlore.bandcamp.com/album/blunted-breaks-vol-1\">Blunted Breaks Vol.1 by Earl Grey</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nDrum N Bass pioneer and legend Goldie also decided to releases a compilation of his old material from the 90s, on his own pioneering and legendary Metalheadz label. To be honest, there are no surprises here. After more than 20 years, the label continues to be active and it rarely strays far from the blueprint it set in the mid-90s. **25 Years of Goldie \\[Unreleased and Re-Mastered]** is Metalheadz through and through: full of dark, futuristic, esoteric rollers - the kind of music that heavily influenced Grime and Dubstep. While there are no revelations, the music is consistently great. Some people have criticized the mastering, but if you're not an audiophile, you won't notice whatever faults there might be. And if you're one of the older fans who've been waiting a long time for some of these tracks to be released, well, have at it.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Rob & Goldie - Shadow VIP [Re-Mastered]\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=949849740/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=772164438/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://metalheadz.bandcamp.com/album/metarsdg001-goldie-presents-25-years-of-goldie-unreleased-and-re-mastered\">METARSDG001 - Goldie presents '25 Years of Goldie [Unreleased and Re-Mastered]' by Goldie presents Rob & Goldie</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Internal Affairs - Shinin' Down On Me (J Majik VIP Rmx) [Re​-​Mastered]\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=949849740/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2921230477/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://metalheadz.bandcamp.com/album/metarsdg001-goldie-presents-25-years-of-goldie-unreleased-and-re-mastered\">METARSDG001 - Goldie presents '25 Years of Goldie [Unreleased and Re-Mastered]' by Goldie presents Internal Affairs</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nLastly, we have **Fifth Column**, another compilation, this one by Rupture London. The label has been going on for about six years now, offering music that recalls the Metalheadz sound (right before it got rid of the drum breaks), and making it sound new again, seeing where it can go. And it has established itself as an influential force. This is a packed roster, with the likes of Mantra, Dead Man's Chest, Forest Drive West, Sully, and Henry Greenleaf making a showing. If after listening to Goldie's compilation, you still have a craving for more futuristic rollers, this one has 16 tracks worth, all of it gold.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mantra - Nocturne\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2178143141/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=158420046/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://ruptureldn.bandcamp.com/album/the-fifth-column\">The Fifth Column by RuptureLDN</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Forest Drive West - Last Day\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2178143141/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2154818295/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://ruptureldn.bandcamp.com/album/the-fifth-column\">The Fifth Column by RuptureLDN</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n## But Where has the Future Gone?: 160+ bpm Edition\n\nSo now that we've gone through four compilations of old school (and old school influenced) Jungle and Drum n Bass, you might be wondering where the \"modern stuff\" is. In many ways, the music is still the same. I remember an interview from 2006 in which Kode9 talks about the new Dubstep genre: \"_In an ideal world, anything goes. The thing that's consistent in the music is the subbass. It's got a good solid subbass foundation. And, as I said, in an ideal world, anything goes on top of that._\" So what are the foundations of Drum N Bass? Three things come to my mind: subbass, percussion, and a fast tempo (above 160 bpm). I'm not trying to say that anything can be Drum n Bass, just that there can be more open interpretations than one might expect.\n\nFirst off, another (!) compilation, **Samurai Music Decade (Phase 2)**, by the Samurai Music label. Their output could be categorized as \"leftfield\" or \"experimental\" Drum n Bass. Sonically, it takes a lot from Industrial Techno. It's dark and brooding, heavy yet atmospheric, with distant, thumping percussion\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Untouchables - Zaku\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2935215445/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=279063798/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://samuraimusic.bandcamp.com/album/samurai-music-decade-phase-2\">Samurai Music Decade (Phase 2) by The Untouchables</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Homemade Weapons & Torn - Spectre\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2935215445/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3137157876/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://samuraimusic.bandcamp.com/album/samurai-music-decade-phase-2\">Samurai Music Decade (Phase 2) by Homemade Weapons & Torn</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nNext, we have Etch's **East Coast Jungleworx Vol. 1**. A short album comprised of edits of 90s Hip Hops tracks. As the name implies, the music has a Jungle feel to it, but it also has a heavy Juke/Footwork influence at some points, and those Trap hi-hats make an appearance here and there. It's a great marriage of 90s music (Boom Bap and Jungle) with 2010s taste (Juke/Footwork and Trap), resulting in something that sounds fresh.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Smiff N Wessun - Bucktown (Etch ReConsctrvction)\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1816677184/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2189536875/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://buy-etch-some-clothes.bandcamp.com/album/btg-x-etch-present-east-coast-jungleworx-vol-1\">BTG x Etch Present...

St. Petersburg's A.Fruit (aka Anna Fruit) offers an exhilarating 40-minute mix of high-tempo bass music, going from Halftime, to Juke, to Trap, to Jungle, to other weird, genreless concoctions. Does it count as being Drum n Bass? Well, what she does is very close to what Sinistarr does in Detroit, or what the Defrostatica Records crew does in Leipzig, or the Aufect gang in Vancouver. And they, like A.Fruit, are all part of the Drum n Bass circuit. In any case, when you're not sure what to classify something as, chances are that it's fresh and exciting.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"A.Fruit - SSS Podcast #372\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/516633846&amp;color=%2316a69e&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />","name":"20181126_the-past-is-now-drum-n-bass-edition","urlPath":"/article/20181126_the-past-is-now-drum-n-bass-edition"},{"publicationDate":"Nov 18, 2018","title":"Hardcore Will Never Die","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/hardcore.jpg.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"Pearsall's mix of \"fresh\", \"new\" Hardcore shows one curious thing: the revival and imitation of an era and genre that actively pushed against those two things.","body":"As I was reading through Simon Reynolds' [blog](http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com/), I stumbled upon an interesting [blog post](http://sonicrampage.org/blog/2018/09/pearsall-presents-future-proofed-fresh-breakbeat-hardcore-mix/) that Reynolds himself linked to, in which the blogger Pearsall shares his own mix of old school breakbeat Hardcore made by new players in these last couple of years. As I've said in my previous post about today's unabashed retroism, recent years have been fruitful for all different styles of music made by artists whose eyes are fixated on the rear view mirror, some of whom are happy with not going much further than imitation. Pearsall acknowledges this:\n\n> _\"If we're honest, most of the tracks betray precisely no influence from musical developments of the last 20+ years, something that, to me, brings up many interesting questions\n> _\n>\n> _This is because the original hardcore rave sound arose in a musical, social, and political context that is very different from the one we experience today, a whole confluence of events  that cannot be recreated. It also can't be ignored that the scene was like a huge hive mind focused on relentless change and innovation - the speed of change was breathtaking, and probably without much parallel in recent musical history.\n> _\n>\n> _**So it's an interesting paradox with tracks like the ones I've selected for this mix, in that they are very consciously imitating a moment in time when musicians were desperately trying not to imitate**, but to innovate and keep progressing. It's a bit like modern guitar bands still reaching for that classic garage punk sound, in a sense.\"\n> _\n\nThat last paragraph is very telling. As I've previously said, I attribute this \"Hardcore revivalism/retroism\" to the fact that we have virtually all of the music at our disposal with the help of the Internet. For anyone, music from the past is, or can be, just as relevant as the music from today. Unearthing older music brings the same rewards of \"newness\" as digging into new releases. Consider, for example, the recent and ongoing fascination that young people (Millennials and teenage Gen-Zers) have for City Pop, Japan's funk-glamour-neon-cheesy pop from the 80s, a previously unknown and forgotten genre.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kikuchi Momoko - Adventure\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/il-6ZqPkgGo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nAs to the question, \"Why Hardcore?, well, it seems as if those early rave days have been romanticized and mythologized by everyone that was a part of it. The \"being there\". The \"being part of something new and special\". The \"feeling of freedom and reverie\". For someone that is, say, 20 years old today, there might be some form of longing for those days, reading testimonies and looking through the pictures of a past youth celebrating music, life, drugs, and love. And as Pearsall notes, between 1990 and 1995, things were moving and evolving so fast, that the old school Hardcore sound only lasted a little less than three years before it split into the Jungle and Happy Hardcore scenes. \n\nOut of sheer luck, others were born just in time and were at the right place to live through that era, experience it firsthand. And it came and went. Sure, the sound lived on in the two mentioned genres, but it's not exactly the same, is it? Old school Hardcore has a specificity to it, its own vibe. So why not bring it back? Why not give it one more life? Maybe that specific sound has more left into it, maybe not everything has been exhausted from it? Maybe by recreating those sounds there's a way to bring back the energy of that era - to find whatever it is some are looking for.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Benton - Saxon Fire\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2i9VEnhz00\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nBut, in my opinion, imitation (and nothing but imitation) can only take us so far. It seems to me that if we want to recreate the energy of the old school Hardcore era, we have to dig deeper than its plasticity, to unveil what its spirit and approach were, rather than its specific sonic palette. Hardcore was a bastard genre, a sort of Frankenstein's Monster taking bits and pieces from other genres of that era. Techno of that era. House of that era. RnB of that era. Hip hop of that era. Dancehall of that era. \n\nIf we want to bring back the sense of catharsis that the older generation experienced, we have to start by creating our own bastard genre of today. Taking bits and pieces from the music of today. Techno of today. House of today. Dancehall of today. Etc. And we also have look at new genres that have sprung up in the last two decades: Dubstep, Grime, Funky House, Alternative RnB, Drum n Bass, Afrobeats, Afroswing, Gqom, etc, etc. Only then, I think, can we get our own \"being there\", our own \"being part of something new and special\", and our own \"feeling of freedom and reverie\".\n\nAt the same time, who cares? Good music is good music. As Pearsall writes: \"_...sometimes music is just there to be enjoyed, so maybe I should shut up, stop overthinking things, and have some fun, right?_\"\n\nAnd with that, I leave you with his mix of  \"new school\" old school Hardcore.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Pearsall - Future Proofed (Fresh Breakbeat Hardcore Rave - 100% Vinyl)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/503894454&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />","name":"20181126_hardcore-will-never-die","urlPath":"/article/20181126_hardcore-will-never-die"},{"publicationDate":"Oct 19, 2018","title":"A Look Back - Dubstep Allstars: A Movement Takes Shape","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/dubstepastars01.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"A look back at the creation of a genre - and the two DJs whose vision and selection contributed to shaping it - through the first two Dubstep Allstars volumes.","body":"_\"For emerging scenes that have a newness about them, \\[that are] kind of unique and fresh, vital in that way that dubstep was, and in that way that grime was, in that way that 2-step garage was, specialism is really, really important, because it's that specialism that allows the music to unravel and develop.

If you were living in London, you might have been able to pick up the signal from the then-pirate radio station, Rinse FM, at home or in your car. And you might have caught DJ Hatcha's show. You listen closely. The music is dark and bassy. Energetic, earthy and esoteric. It's stripped back for the most part - the percussion and the rumbling bass - with minimal instrumentation put on top, usually a sample taken from whatever exotic/\"ethnic\"/oriental music. And you can faintly hear some 2-step Garage influences in the beat patterns, but the music has already begun to stray away from it.\n\nAnd on top you hear the playful and almost nonsensical chatter of MCs Crazy D (mostly) and Beezy.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n_\"Come on Hatcha!

In the early 2000s, a whole bunch of producers and DJs, with backgrounds in UK Garage, started making darker, rawer beats at 140 bpm, often with stylistic influences taken from the darker ends of Jungle and Drum n Bass. In 2003, 15 years ago, Dubstep and Grime hadn't yet crystallized into defined genres.  There were different styles going about within the \"140 sound\" diaspora; from the breakstep garage sound, to dark garage à la DJ Narrows, to sublow, eski beat and dubstep. The Dubstep (dubby 2-step garage) term, from what I understand, was initially used to describe Horsepower Productions' output and all of the  music influenced by it, or which resembled it.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Horsepower Productions - Fist of Fury\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uCEtbd-DqCw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nComing from a UK Garage standpoint, Hatcha started to notice these new variants coming out: \"_I started to pick up on this new sound; it was Garage, but deeper and darker, more intelligent style_.\" His sets gradually shifted entirely towards this new sound. With a record bag full of exclusive and sought-after dubplates, he became one of the most noticeable and influential DJs of this new quasi-scene, having underground producers make beats specifically for him. Two of  them were Skream and Benga, teenagers at the time. Hatcha quickly started to focus on a specific vibe, and as people sent him music, he'd give back instructions to \"_make it darker, more tribal_.\"\n\nWhen people speak of Dubstep's origins, one place always comes up: Croydon, South London. And early-Dubstep is often referred to as the \"Croydon sound\". That all started with Hatcha. He was an employee at the Big Apple Records shop, which was located in Croydon, and which was the hangout spot for a lot of Dubstep pioneers: Skream, Benga, Artwork, Tunnidge, Cyrus, Distance, Benny Ill (from Horsepower Productions), Hijak, etc. Soon after, the DMZ gang joined this group, who were the ones pushing out this bass-heavy, dark, stripped-back, sometimes tribal sound - the Croydon Sound. Early Dubstep.\n\nCompare this track, the sound that Hatcha prefered:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Benny Ill vs DJ Hatcha - Highland Spring\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/th1rDR0jgh4\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nTo this:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Darqwan - Nocturnal (Geeneus Mix)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/34mhcjMQ3E0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nFWD>> (pronounced \"forward\"), was the name of the club night showcasing this new style (among others) and was affiliated with Geeneus' pirate radio station, Rinse FM. The club night was run by Sarah Lockhart and Neil Joliffe, of Ammunitions Ltd, who both also ran Tempa, the most prominent and influential Dubstep label from 2000 to about 2008. Initially a space where Horsepower Productions could release their music, the label's roster grew as producers like Hatcha, Kode9, DJ Abstract, Skream, and DMZ had some of their early work released on there as well. As a way to promote this new music, Tempa saw fit to release an official mix CD as a showcase. Of course, the DJ they would call to make to first volume was DJ Hatcha himself. \n\n**Dubstep Allstars vol 1**, is the first official release with the genre's name. Although the CD came out in 2004, the music appears to be mostly from 2002 to early-2003, as it seems to predate the DMZ era. You can hear it in the music, which still has the 2-step swing into it. Although the mix is missing the lively chatter of Crazy D and Beezy, and even the energy that his radio show had, it still remains a great showcase of the music that initiated this Croydon Sound, with its biggest early players: Kode9, Skream, Benga, Horsepower Productions.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dubstep Allstars Vol. 1 (Mixed by DJ Hatcha)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGOdbP5L-JA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nThe next year saw the release of the second volume of Dubstep Allstars, with Youngsta taking over the decks this time. And this is where the form of Dubstep with which most people are accustomed started to take shape.\n\nYoungsta, Sarah Lockhart's younger brother, was also a South London resident and he'd supposedly been involved in pirate radio since the age of 13, getting his own slot on Rinse FM around 2002. By 2005, due to his unique vision and selection, to his unparalleled technical talents as a DJ, and to his partnership with one of the most unique MCs, Task, Youngsta and his show had grown a sizable following. Now, he is recognized as being probably the most important and influential DJ in Dubstep, as the underground sound still follows the foundation layed out in this second mix CD of the series.\n\nWhile others in this scene were still largely toying with the vibes and rhythms of the darker side of Garage and DnB, Youngsta was more interested in seeing how \"stripped-back\" and \"spaced out\" (his own terms) the music could become. Whereas Hatcha's vision for this music was a rhythmically energetic one, Youngsta's vision brought him to venture further down the minimalist and darker path, and focusing less on the whole \"tribal\"/ethnic aesthetic. The signature groove and swing of Garage music is almost entirely gone here, except for the use of shuffley hi-hats. And he was the one pushing the halfstep sound that everyone associates with the genre, as that familiar beat pattern can be heard in the opening track, Skream's **Babylon**.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dubstep Allstars Vol. 2 (Mixed by DJ Youngsta)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUXllMiXH2g\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nMaking an appearance is the DMZ crew, who make up almost half of the mix. In fact, as Ben UFO also points out in his interview with Red Bull Music, Youngsta was such a specialist, had such a specific taste, that his sets were composed entirely of music from a handful of producers: Mala (of the Digital Mystikz), Loefah, D1, Skream, and sometimes Benga and Coki. That was it, six producers; and only four of them are presented in this mix CD.\n\nDark and atmospheric, the music in this mix is more meditative than actually danceable, but that was the idea. Youngsta didn't do sets to skank to, but to light up a blunt to, and bob your head to the beat, eyes down, as you feel the enormous sub pressure rattle your rib cage.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nBritish underground club music in the early 2000s was probably like what it is now, with different styles floating about, subgenres of subgenres, with a similar vibe threading along each sound, but without any one of them crystallizing to form a new genre. In the early 2000s, underground Garage spored many different styles. While DJs like Slimzee and Geeneus took from that pool to shape what we now know as \"Grime\", Hatcha and Youngsta had also taken from that very same pool, to shape what we now recognize as being \"Dubstep\". And while some of their archived radio sets have been uploaded on Soundcloud and Mixcloud, Tempa's first two entries of their **Dubstep Allstars** series remain great points of reference to listen to where the genre comes from, and who built it.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/dubstepastars03.png)","name":"20181124_a-look-back-dubstep-allstars-a-movement-takes-shape","urlPath":"/article/20181124_a-look-back-dubstep-allstars-a-movement-takes-shape"},{"publicationDate":"Sep 26, 2018","title":"Peverelist's Bass Music: Jungle Re-Contextualized","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/pev01.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"It's interesting to think about musical influences, whether it's how a certain genre, artist, scene, or track has influenced another certain genre, scene or artist, and so on.","body":"It's interesting to think about musical influences, whether it's how a certain genre, artist, scene, or track has influenced another certain genre, scene or artist, and so on. To think about musical influences is to think about how musical elements and styles tend to get passed on, from one era to another; about how they survive (or die, if ignored), and how they're used to create something new.\n\nOne of my favourite electronic music producers is undoubtedly **Peverelist**. In wanting to promote fresh bass music from his city of Bristol, he started the _Punch Drunk _label in 2006. Even before its Brostep variant took over the EDM festival circuit in 2010, Dubstep was all the rage in the underground. The subbass-powered, dread-filled, skankstep sound from London sounded like nothing before. And as with Jungle and Drum N Bass, the sound promptly made its way to the port city. Notable producers in the genre that have appeared on Peverelist's label are: Pinch, Gemmy, RSD (from the legendary Bristolian act, Smith & Mighty), Kahn, Shorstuff (aka Mickey Pearce), etc. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Pinch - 136 Trek\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYoTTvDnb2A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nEver since the start of Rave and Hardcore, Bristol has, from what I've read here and there, always been in the shadow of the capital. But maybe that is less so today. In 2011, Peverelist starts a second label, _Livity Sound_. Possibly because of his waning interest in Dubstep (which had become formulaic by then), the label served as a venue to push out forward-thinking, yet still club-oriented, bass music from a crew of Bristol producers. Livity Sound, in a way, was a continuation of the Techno-infused Dubstep style that was going on in the late 2000s (which the Punch Drunk label also showcased). But the tempo had changed, going from 140 to about 125-130, stepping away from the Dubstep scene. As with the labels Swamp 81, Night Slugs and Hessle Audio, Livity Sound's output is an important pillar of the current \"UK Hardcore\" sound going on right now (which I wrote about [here](http://patkardenaz.blogspot.com/2018/08/uk-techno-bass-percussion-bass-hard.html)). While it has settled into a certain comfort zone in the last two years, the label's  prior willingness to takes chances and surprise  has made it one of the most influential and important labels of this decade in underground electronic/club/rave music.\n\nPeverelist, the label boss, the don, is at the center of it. Although he started in the Dubstep scene, and his current music can be lightly qualified as \"Techno\" or \"UK Bass\" (depending on who you ask), to my ears, he's always made the same music. Sound system music: Bass music that follows the UK Hardcore tradition. Throughout his discography, one idea that comes back, ever since his first releases, is his tendency to fuse the attacking, ricocheting subbass of Jungle and Drum N Bass with the established machine-soul sound of (Detroit) Techno. The Dubstep genre, I believe, was initially the perfect space to try this, at a time when it still seemed like there was uncharted territories to explore in the genre, over 10 years ago.\n\nPeverelist has a sound of his own that is instantly recognizable. Outside of his preferred hi-hats, warm kicks and melancholic synths, the element that gives his music his own signature style in the realm of Techno is the dizzying grooves he takes from Jungle and Drum N Bass. This made sense to me when he's said in interviews that his roots, as a DJ and raver, lie in those genres. Back in 2012, he uploaded an old Jungle mix he made sometime in the late 90s (listen [here](https://youtu.be/an_doDWB_ow)). \n\nLet's take a look at two tracks taken from that mix: Shut Up & Dance's remix of The Godfather's \"Somebody\", released in 1995 on Red Light; and \"Never Felt\", by an anonymous artist, released in 1995 on Hard 'N' Heavy. A chance to get acquainted with Peverelist's own musical influences.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Godfather - Somebody (Shut Up & Dance Remix)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wi-NN9lPLVc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Unknown Artist - Never Felt\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZU9fBJAaFI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nOne of the main characteristics of Jungle is the drum breaks manipulation at fast tempos. Not unlike Hip Hop, the breaks are sliced up and re-assembled however the producer wants to. However, in Jungle, the breaks are put together in a unpredictable fashion. There is a dominant beat pattern in each track, but the producers have fun and deviate from it by offering different variables after every couple of bars or so, without interrupting the groove (for the skankers at the rave). Different percussive elements are highlighted at different times: skittering attacks from snares or hi-hats, or cymbals (or even applied filter effects) that cut out as suddenly and quickly as they jumped in. This creates that dizzying, offbeat swing that is intrinsic to the genre. A world apart from both House and Techno's motorik beats.\n\nAlso pay attention to the bass underneath all that. In a lot of cases, I don't think we can talk about bass lines. \"Bass line\", to me, implies a player, a musician, that has everything seemingly under control. The bass in Jungle is anything but that; it's an untamed beast. Notice how, in both tracks, at every 2 bars or so, the subbass jumps in, bouncing around rapidly and successively, almost as if it wanted to burst out of the speakers, before sliding down and subduing itself momentarily, until it jumps in again. With the percussion on top, it creates a feeling of chaos and, with it, a spike in energy.\n\nIn regards to the bouncy, offbeat bass, and how Peverelist uses that stylistic element within a Techno track, let's take a look at two of my favourites from last year: his remix of Roberto's \"Chord Recall\"** **(Solar Phenoma) and his own** \"**Wireframes: (Livity Sound). [_\\*Note: Listen with headphones or speakers with adequate bass response_]. Notice the bass in his re-imagining of \"Chord Recall\". That ricocheting, offbeat subbass, almost straight out of a Jungle track, jumps in at the start of every bar. Stylistically, the reverberated chords echoing throughout are fairly typical of Techno. But, until the strings come in at midpoint, the immense bass takes center stage, giving the track weight, forward momentum and a dizzying swing.  In \"Wireframes\", the same idea is applied, but we can hear some percussive work come into play. The offbeat subbass attacks paired with the kicks create the same effect as in the \"Chord Recall\" remix. Peverelist layers in swinging hi-hats, snares and claps that dance around the bass. None of the elements ever seem to stay put.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Roberto - Chord Recall (Peverelist Remix)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/heLHtSw6YeE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Peverelist - Wireframes\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OO0bvOR1lWs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nFinally, let's take a look at one of his \"Dubstep\" tracks, from his Punch Drunk label: Fighting Without Fighting, released in 2010. This is the track that actually brought me to think about how Peverelist utilizes his Jungle influences to create new music. In this track, the chaotic impulses of Jungle are present, in both the percussion and the bass. The bass is relentless; again, it bounces around continuously, with almost no break to its assault on your speakers. While the drum breaks aren't there, listen to the snares and hi-hats. They're spastic, uncontrollable, unpredictable. The hi-hats sometimes come and go as they please. There's no fixed motif with the beat pattern. Peverelist adds his touch, with the melancholic melodies and restrained Techno chords which give the track some type of shape that the listener can grasp onto. Sure, it doesn't have the rudebwoy swagger of Jungle, but this track definitely shares its sense of controlled chaos; and I think that there is definite lineage to be traced here.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Peverelist - Fighting Without Fighting\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6n3hql89KZI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nIs \"Fighting Without Fighting\" actually Dubstep? Or is it Jungle? Or is it both? When I heard the track, I didn't know what to make of it. Only when I realized that Peverelist might be trying, as previously mentioned, to seamlessly combine Jungle/Drum N Bass and Techno did I start to make sense of it. As I stated in the opening paragraph, I found it interesting to see how someone's musical baggage affects their compositions, how they might use it, re-contextualize it, to create something fresh, something yet unheard. Jungle and Drum N Bass aren't viewed as \"forward-thinking music\" anymore, but their sound lives on in music that is considered as such. At least, people like Peverelist are seeing to it.","name":"20181104_peverelist-s-bass-music-jungle-re-contextualized","urlPath":"/article/20181104_peverelist-s-bass-music-jungle-re-contextualized"},{"publicationDate":"Sep 04, 2018","title":"The Past is Now. The Future was then.","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/past.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"While some, like me, will decry the ongoing retroism as a force of creative stagnancy, maybe there's something to it, an energy worth preserving.","body":"It's the evening, and I'm listening to George Clanton's newly released _Slide_. It's an enjoyable synthpop album. Great melodies, cool sounds, yadda, yadda, yadda. However, what is striking to me about this album, is how its retro sound _isn't striking_. The synth work and the sampled drum breaks entirely assume a 90s vibe, but never does it sound novel.  I think it's safe to say that retro sounds are no longer particular or audacious stylistic choices in music. It's as if we've accepted the sounds from  the past into our current lives. They are just a palette among many. In Google Play, in Spotify, in Youtube, I have at my fingertips an immense collection of music from every era. When it comes to modern music (i.e. from the 60s onwards), everything falls into a sort of musical mosaic while listening on a digital platform.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"George Clanton - Slide\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kieVYydeEOQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nHow could it not? So many modern acts borrow directly from the past. Sure, there are some modern tendencies, notably when it comes to lyrical content, vocal melodies and vocal delivery in pop music, that distinguish them from older styles. But when it comes to song arrangements and instrumentation, past works serve as inspiration, to the point where it's not just inspiration but imitation at times.\n\nI think of electronic music right now. I wrote the article highlighting what I considered as \"[the new Hardcore](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_uk-techno-bass-percussion-bass-hard-drums-the-new-hardcore)\" in UK rave music. I also consider it as being \"new\" and \"fresh\". But let's just think about everything else. Look at House music. In 2006, Loefah said in a dubstep documentary that \"_House and Techno have been doing the same thing for 10-15 years_\". It's 2018 now, and House is still the same. Same tempos, same chord progressions. Mostly, look at Lo-fi  House, probably the biggest underground electronic genre in the last few years outside of Big Room/Festival Techno (is that still considered \"underground\"?). The genre is shamelessly retro, not only in its sound but in the names that some producers have given themselves (DJ Seinfeld? Ross from Friends?). It's biggest hit is probably DJ Boring's \"Winona\". \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Boring - Winona\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ar9qA3WJInk\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nLo-fi House's main characteristic is its fixation on the past, a whole scene dedicated to sonically reliving the past. But the retro fixation is also present in other genres. Jungle and Drum N Bass are going through a resurgence in interest right now. And while there are certainly labels that are trying to push fresh stuff, there is no ignoring the continued veneration of the 90s sound, especially when it comes to Jungle. Tim Rearper, Coco Bryce, Pheneus II, Dead Man's Chest are but some that have given a new life to the Jungle sound of '93, when Jungle still had a heavy House influence. This year also saw the release of a compilation titled _Hardcore Will Never Die_, for which various modern producers made Hardcore/Breakbeat Techno tracks as a showcase.\n\nIn Techno, the old Detroit sound lives on as a major influence for a lot of producers. Even in Dancehall, I've recently realized that some of my preferred riddims are callbacks to the 80s and/or 90s. And, as I've stated in my Mala entry, underground Dubstep continues to gravitate around a _fetishization _of the \"true sound\", the 2006 sound, the DMZ and Tectonic sound. As such, the music is still the same thing as it was back then.\n\nActually, to say that \"it's still the same thing\" is a bit unfair. I can only guess as to why a younger generation of producers is so fascinated with the past when, usually, in Electronic music, it is the notion of the future that is an important source of inspiration. There was a time when Electronic music's \"evolution\" was dictated by technological advancements and  a growing accessibility of recording and studio equipment. But we seem to have plateau'd (for now) in that regard.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Etch - Dreamst8\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/444292581&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nIn terms of underground Electronic music, the 80s and 90s were wild years. But I, like everyone aged under about 35, only know so through reading about it and listening to the available music. The music from those years still serves as a sort of guide (or template) for what is current (well, maybe not for the whole \"deconstructed/post club\" thing). Even more \"modern\" sounding stuff like Bass House can find some of its stylistic origins in Tear Out Drum N Bass, French House and Trance from the 90s. And so, when we read about how those years have been mythologized by older ravers, and when we listen to the music and hear how it's so distant and different, yet so familiar, of course people are bound to be fixated on it.\n\nA certain longing arises for those \"mythological\" years, regardless if someone \"was there\" or not. We hear how incredibly vital Hardcore and Jungle were, but those scenes were at their peak for only a couple of years. At the time, most people were intent on \"moving things forwards\", with \"finding the new\": \"_That amazing track that came out 6-7 months ago, that's old history now._\" So producers take those old aesthetics, and bring them back, make them new again. Because maybe we want to experience them now, live them in our own way. Because maybe there still might be possibilities for new explorations using those old aesthetics.  Could someone in '95 have made a track like Subjoi's \"The Way I Feel**\" **or Mall Grab's \"Feel U\", or Denham Audio \"Cinnamon Vanilla\", or Dead Man's Chest \"Avalon Dub\"?\n\nThe answers is: who knows. Maybe. Maybe not. There was a time when innovation was the name of the game in Electronic/Club/Rave. It seems as if innovation might be a tad overrated.\n\nSo just let's just listen and enjoy the music, and maybe ignore everything I've just written.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dead Man's Chest - Avalon Dub\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDLrczpYT3o\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Denham Audio - Cinnamon Vanilla\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Y-GG-57BM\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mall Grab - Feel U\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHm5H3OfvPM\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Subjoi - The Way I Feel\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lfzOSdFeSg\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />","name":"20181123_the-past-is-now-the-future-was-then","urlPath":"/article/20181123_the-past-is-now-the-future-was-then"}],"links":{"previousPage":null,"nextPage":"/category/musings2"}}
