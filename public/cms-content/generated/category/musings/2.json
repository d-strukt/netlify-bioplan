Today, the Hardcore sound is prolonged by a new wave of bass and percussion music.\n","body":"I'd like to expand on my thoughts in the \"[What is the New Hardcore?](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181104_what-is-the-new-hardcore)\" article - which ended with the \"_I don't know_\" remark - by reasserting two possible answers that I had given:\n\n> _**\"... Is it in the rolling, subbass-y beats of techno-meets-dubstep being pushed out by Kaizen, Livity Sound, Version, Timedance, etc? \\[...] Is it in the highly percussive, bassy works of labels like Nervous Horizon, Sans Absence? ...\"\n> **_\n\nThose two styles, I think, represent the Hardcore sound right now. And as is usual with new styles of music, they have no official names, as they are barely discernible scenes in the immense, ever-growing and constantly-morphing world of electronic music.\n\nThe first one is, in a practical sense, techno, but it's a \"UKifed\" version of  techno. Generally called \"bass\" and/or categorized as \"uk techno\", it's the continuation of the early sound of [South London-era Dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEJG9L-n_tE) (circa 2003-5),to my ears. The most important labels in shaping this style are Swamp81, Livity Sound and Hessle Audio. Other labels pushing this sound include: Kaizen, Mistry, Timedance, Durkle Disco, Jelly Bean Farm, Artifice Music, Circular Jaw, etc, etc.\n\nThe second one is very percussive - almost tribal-like - with influences from UK Funky, Gqom and even Soca. On Soundcloud, most often than not, \"percussion bass\" and \"hard drum(s)\" tags are used to categorize the uploaded mixes and tracks. The most prominent labels are Nervous Horizon and Sans Absence.\n\nJust like Dubstep and Grime were once both part of the \"140 sound\" diaspora in the early 2000s (before becoming crystallized genres onto their own), so should \"UK Techno\" and \"Percussion Bass\" be considered as being part of the same \"bass\" diaspora of the current \"UK\" scene. I put \"UK\" in quotation marks because, although the sound still revolves around the UK soundsystem tradition of \"Hardcore\", people from all over the world practice it already.\n\nTypically around 120 to 130 bpm, the music is_ (sub)bassy_ and _percussively _inclined. What matters here is creating a rude, weighty groove - and that is the defining characteristic. A track's structure usually follows the conventions of Hardcore (as seen in Drum N Bass and Dubstep) - 1) an intro, 2) a drop, 3) a bridge and  4) a second drop.\n\nIt can be tribal and ostentatious, or meditative and moody (or anything in-between). It can put the drums at the forefront of the mix, or let the subbass breathe out.  It can be influenced by the thumping percussion of Gqom and Soca, the deep pulse of Techno, or the bass dread of early Dubstep. And when it comes to beat patterns, it can throw some Baltimore Club and Vogue in there too, for good measure. Like Jungle and Drum n Bass at their inception, it's a bastard sound, taking cues from everywhere, respective of current tastes.\n\nOk, but what does it sound like? Or, better put, what can it sound like? Remember, no formula is set in stone yet, so let's look at some examples...\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n♪\n\nFirst, a perfect example of  \"UK techno\": the duo **Silas and Snare**'s \"Biometric\" on the Manchester-based label Kaizen. Heavy and prominent syncopated kicks, a sliding subbass (like in old-school Dubstep), and Techno synths:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Silas & Snare - Biometric\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1401239276/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3423876283/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://kaizenltd.bandcamp.com/album/biometric\">Biometric by Silas & Snare</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nSecond, a perfect example of \"Percussion Bass\" (or \"Hard Drums\"), this one from London-based label, Sans Absence. The label started out as a sort of UK Funky revival collective, but has been leaning towards this style in the last year. French producer **Noire **serves up the track \"2nd Guessin**'\"**, a monstruous, ravey, Soca-like percussive exercise:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Noire - 2nd Guessin'\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/401899980&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nHessle Audio co-founder, **Pearson Sound**, released a defining track two years ago, \"XLB\": snappy, syncopated drums and a rolling subbass in an huge build-up, with an immense mid-track drop:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Pearson Sound - XLB\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265368071&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\n**Peverelist**, Livity Sound boss, who started his raving days as a Jungle head and his production career in Dubstep way back in 2007, made what is probably my favourite track from last year, \"Wireframes\": A dizzying, bouncing groove with an immense subbass.

This time, with \"Neans Anthem\": \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Neana - Neans Anthem\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/392362911&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nLastly, a track in this sound can also be more subdued, but still be endowed with that signature UK rudeness (i.e. a Dancehall and Hardcore influence, typical of UK sound system music ). Drum N Bass producer, **Henry Greenleaf**, dropping all the way down to around 125 bpm, does just that with \"In Same\":\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf - In Same\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/476473071&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n## Further listening (links)\n\n[Fox - Big Man Ting (Meta Remix) (Unreleased)](https://soundcloud.com/metauk/fox-big-man-ting-meta-remix-kaizen-nts-rip)\n\n[Bash & T (Julio Basmore and T.Williams) - EC (2018, Conch Records)](https://conchrecords.bandcamp.com/track/ec)\n\n[Beneath - Special Offer (2018, Mistry)](https://mistrymuzik.bandcamp.com/track/special-offer)\n\n[Denham Audio & MC Serocee - Masta Blastah (2018, Durkle Disco)](https://durkledisco.bandcamp.com/track/masta-blastah-caski-remix)\n\n[Alex Coulton - Ambush (2016, Tempa)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHD0sFB-tHE)\n\n[Hodge - Light Wave (2017, Livity Sound)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyAFjRPPu_c)\n\n[Piezo - Keera (2017, Swamp81)](https://soundcloud.com/piezoofficial/keera)\n\n[Tessela - Glisten (2018, Whities)](https://whities.bandcamp.com/track/glisten)\n\n[Cousin - Ruff Draft (2016, Swamp81)](https://soundcloud.com/cousinofficial/ruff-draft)\n\n[Markee Ledge - Make Your Move (Addison Groove Remix), (2016, Skeleton)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru76j8sY88I)\n\n[Randomer & Hodge - Second Freeze (2016, Dnuos Ytivil)](https://livitysound.bandcamp.com/track/second-freeze)\n\n[Soreab - Bifle (Lamont Remix) (2018, Beat Machine Records)](https://soundcloud.com/hyponik-com/first-listen-soreab-bifle-lamont-remix)\n\n[Lava Dome - Closer (Galtier Remix) (2018)](https://soundcloud.com/hyponik-com/first-listen-lava-dome-closer-galtier-remix)\n\n[Jaymie Silk - Immersion (2018, Frite Nite)](https://soundcloud.com/seeksicksound/premiere-jaymie-silk-immersion-forthcoming-frite-nite)\n\n[Rushmore - Rolling O's (2018, Merge Layers)](https://soundcloud.com/mixmag-1/premiere-rushmore-rolling-os)","name":"20181123_uk-techno-bass-percussion-bass-hard-drums-the-new-hardcore","urlPath":"/article/20181123_uk-techno-bass-percussion-bass-hard-drums-the-new-hardcore"},{"publicationDate":"Aug 03, 2018","title":"20 Years Later : Massive Attack - Mezzanine","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/massive-attack.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"Mezzanine turned 20 this year, and it's still as excellent as ever. I look back at one the first electronic albums I've loved, and see where it stands today.","body":"I remember, oh about 11 or 12 years ago, when I had just taken the plunge into the world of music geekdom, reading reviews and articles,  and seeking out new artists and albums to add on my endless \"to listen\" list, I had noticed that this album was often mentioned as a landmark work from the 90s. Admittedly, I also remember ignoring it for the simple fact that the cover put me off (and I still stand by my opinion that it is an ugly cover). But after listening to DJ Shadow's renowned _Endtroducing _(and loving it), and upon further reading, I learned that _Mezzanine _is regarded as one of the three masterpieces of the Trip-Hop genre (with Portishead's Dummy completing the trio).\n\nMezzanine was definitely a grower. At just over the hour-long mark, it was then one of the longest albums I had listened to. It's essentially an hour-long listen of slow-tempo'd tracks, with most of them taking their time to build. And I had not yet developed the patience as a listener that I have today. However, right off the bat, there was no denying the strength of the first four tracks. Angel, especially, remains one of the most memorable openers: the ominous-yet-sexy bassline and riff,  the reverent vocals singing \"You are my angel/Come from way above/To bring me love\", and the rock-out crescendo are hard to forget.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/massive-attack-2.jpg)\n\nThere is an undeniable sensuality to the music, what with the slow, prominent basslines, the sleazy riffs, the whispered male vocals and the soft, angelic female vocals. There's a heavy sense of desire, of fulfilled and unfulfilled love and intimacy. But the brooding bass and the dubwise effects give this album some sense of claustrophobia and dread underlying the lyricism, itself revolving around the themes of love, self-awareness, self-doubt, alienation and deception:\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n_\"I need a little love to ease the pain_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n_You're not my savior, but I still won't go_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n_I could fake it, but I still want more_\n\nFor my money, Mezzanine is still an exceptional album, but where does it stand now, 20 years later? Where does it fit in the pantheon of electronic music, that has flourished exponentially this last decade?\n\nI feel like it has since been overshadowed by Burial's early work, which showcases a blend of the bass dread from Croydon-era Dubstep, with the melancholic vocal samples manipulated like those in a Todd Edwards record - a combination which seems to resonate more with today's young generation. Even though Massive Attack's music shares some fundamental elements with that of Burial's (namely, the Dub Reggae influence and the melancholic vibe), the latter is able to exert the cathartic reverberations of dance music and the UK rave music sound. This, I think, is more in line with today's tastes. What's more, I think that younger listeners are more interested in discovering House, Techno, Jungle, Garage, etc, from the 90s than to listen to the rockist canon of album-oriented, \"acceptable\" electronic music that has, at this point, little new to offer.  \n\nNotably, Mezzanine is regarded as the last great Trip-Hop album. I've even read people calling this the final nail in the coffin for the genre. Because, the sentiment goes:_ how do you top this? _ And even though there have been new Trip-Hop acts that have sprung up in the new millennium, the genre remains attached to the 90s in the general consciousness (like Grunge is). In the mid-2000s, I think people still had hope that the genre would make a comeback, based on the strength of this, Tricky's and Portihead's works. It never did, of course.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/massive-attack-3.jpg)\n\nMassive Attack did eventually make a comeback after a long hiatus. However, they have never been able to match this album. The music in this album has ambition, but it is never too ostentatious in its production tricks. This approach has permitted it to age gracefully. If this album sounds like a 90s album, it's because the Trip-Hop sound happens to be heavily influenced by Boom Bap (even then, only in regards to drum programming). Lastly,  its strength lies simply in its memorable songwriting. It might take a little patience to soak it in, but once the music grabs you, it never really lets go. I listen to it maybe once every two years now, but I'd be lying if I said that bits and pieces of this album don't pop into my head every now and then.\n\n__","name":"20181123_20-years-later-massive-attack-mezzanine","urlPath":"/article/20181123_20-years-later-massive-attack-mezzanine"},{"publicationDate":"Jul 31, 2018","title":"What Is the New Hardcore?","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/pic01.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"The genesis of Rave in the UK shaped the \"Hardcore\" sound, from which Jungle and Drum N Bass are derived. What is it? And how does it manifest itself today?","body":"During the 90s, British music journalist Simon Reynolds chronicled his experience with UK Rave music, witnessing its genesis during the Second Summer of Love. From the squelching sounds of Acid House, to the hefty breaks of  ['Ardcore Techno](https://youtu.be/wtJoAtXtad4), to the kinetic amen manipulation of [Jungle](https://youtu.be/YaKEGzTYnik), and futuristic bass exploitation of [Drum N Bass](https://youtu.be/ufcRRtRbSfs), he, as many others, witnessed at first-hand the rapid pace at which rave music evolved from '88 to '95 (that's four genres in seven years, think about it) - shaped in warehouse and open-field parties, infiltrating clubs and pirate radio, and taking over the UK's youth.\n\nBorrowing elements of American music (House, Techno, Electro and Hip Hop), Jamaican music (Dub Reggae and Dancehall), and European music (New Beat), Hardcore, aka Breakbeat Techno and Breakbeat Hardcore, initiated a musical tradition recognized by some as the \"Hardcore Sound\". In his Red Bull Music Academy appearance, dubstep pioneer and Hyperdub label-head Kode9 describes it succinctly: \"_The hardcore sound came when electronic music clashed with Jamaican soundsystem culture in London_\". \n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/title.jpg)\n\nHardcore was the result of a youth thirsty for all kinds of new dance music (even \"getting\" Techno before most Americans did ). It was the end-result of a youth having been exposed to Jamaican music, as it was supposedly not unusual to hear the heavy rumble of the bass coming out the sound systems when strolling around certain areas of London.\n\nHardcore was not just the sound itself, it was also the presentation: The DJ (selector) and the MC (toaster), the bass bins, the pull-ups (rewinds), the DJs competing and scrambling for \"dubplates\" (the exclusives, the VIP versions,  the unreleased tracks cut on 10\" acetate records). Hardcore re-contextualized these Jamaican musical traditions in its new, twisted form of electronic dance music. It was normal to hear the MC, possibly of Caribbean origins, hyping up the crowd over the drum breaks, the subbass and the rave stabs. The British created their own brand of sound system culture.\n\nSimon Reynolds observed that Jungle and Drum N Bass, both derivations of Hardcore, took over its mantle of hybridity and innovation, keeping some of its elements, adding new ones, but always staying in the UK soundsystem scene. Even though they were new genres, they were a continuation of the Hardcore sound. It defined underground club music and pirate radio in London and, as we now know, the sound lived on in the genres of the new millennium. As Londoners got a hold of [Garage House](https://youtu.be/r8uKbprFjIE) from New York, they wasted no time in morphing it into their own style. The swiveling swing of the 2-Step variant of UK Garage was the perfect host for the syncopation and bouncing subbass introduced during the Jungle era: [sample](https://youtu.be/G3fE-mNRFrs), [sample](https://youtu.be/FzEnST_vJiE), [sample](https://youtu.be/tjuynOikZkA).\n\nIn the early 2000s, Jungle and Drum N Bass - once on the bleeding-edge of, not just club music, but music in general - had become extremely formulaic, even a little sanitized. But from the 2-Step Garage scene, in London, there emerged two new genres that continued the tradition of Hardcore: Grime and Dubstep. \n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/pic02.jpg)\n\nIn Grime, the MCing tradition of UK dance/rave/soundsystem music took center-stage, as MCs arrived from the Jungle and Drum N Bass scenes, in which their roles had once been to complement the DJ's selection. In Dubstep, a small group of producers and DJs - from London, Bristol and Manchester - came together to push the bass mutations even further into a weirder, fresher style. That deep, rumbling subbass that was part of the London soundscape became the focal point of the genre, taking influences from 2-step Garage, Broken Beat, Minimal Techno, Dancehall, Drum N Bass and Dub Reggae.\n\nBy the mid to late 2000s, Bassline and Funky House (aka UK Funky) also made a sizable impact, the former pushing the sound of Speed Garage into more aggressive territories; and Funky, becoming some sort of mutation between House and Grime, mashed together with Afro-Carribean and West African club music. ([sample](https://youtu.be/l3TPRpgudtM)).\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nBut what now? Around 2010, as the more aggro side of Dubstep (pejoratively called \"Brostep\") started taking over the world,  a new sound was emerging from the underground. Labels like Hessle Audio, 3024, Swamp81, Punch Drunk, NonPlus, etc, took cues from House, Techno and Electro, blending them with the dubwise approach of old-school Dubstep. 140 bpm went down to 132, and eventually in the 120-130 bpm territory. But this short movement didn't last long, or, better put, it never truly gave way to a solidified, cohesive movement. Some continued it. A lot ended up doing formulaic House and Techno. Some even went back to Drum n Bass, or Dubstep. And others seem to change style every couple of years, going to genreless beats to other, unclassifiable, genreless beats, sometimes delving into borderline pastiches of what is considered trendy, but never really trying to blend the many influences in a seamless way, as Hardcore had once done.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/pic03.jpg)\n\nIf there's one thing that has defined underground electronic music in the 2010s, it's the new fluidity that artists now have. Gone are the days of forced musical rigidity in the DJ's set. Of course, there are still purists, and they will always be there. But the internet has expanded people's tastes, making them more aware of the past and present, letting them get involved in local and global music. And the new DJing equipment has opened up new possibilities, enabling a new school of DJs to swiftly and seamlessly execute tempo and genre switches, going from rolling techno, to electronic reggaeton beats, to distorted gabber, for example. \n\nAnd, as it is evident now, the toast MC's are almost gone, no longer an essential part of the music. When one does make an appearance, it's usually because it's a celebrated MC from the past. Also, I have to say that comments such as \"fuck this mc prick\" and \"shut up you mug\" found on Youtube and Soundcloud have possibly left their mark on the culture, or they could be hints of changed tastes.\n\nStill, we linger on with \"the roots\", content with keeping the \"original sounds\" of Grime, Dubstep and Drum n Bass alive. Recently, lo-fi house and outsider house have attracted new fans into the world of underground club music. What characterizes this music is, in my opinion, a sort of fixation on the past, a sort of old-school deep house revival. \n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/pic05.jpg)\n\nBut what is the new Hardcore? Has the sound been reinterpreted into a new genre? Is it in the rolling, subbass-y beats of techno-meets-dubstep being pushed out by Kaizen, Livity Sound, Version, Timedance, etc? Is it in this deconstructed, post-club, industrial-meets-reggaeton-meets-traps-meets-baltimore-club that has risen in these last three or so years? Is it in the highly percussive, bassy works of labels like Nervous Horizon, Sans Absence? Or is it in all of these at once?\n\nAnd to add to that, the \"UK sound\" isn't just the UK anymore, as artists from New York, Berlin, Los Angeles, Montreal, Amsterdam, Melbourne, etc, now make \"UK bass\" music.\n\nI don't even know.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Batu - Live @ Timedance 24.02.18, The White Hotel\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/416037318&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />","name":"20181104_what-is-the-new-hardcore","urlPath":"/article/20181104_what-is-the-new-hardcore"}],"links":{"previousPage":"/category/musings1","nextPage":null}}
