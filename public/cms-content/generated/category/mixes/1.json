I understand why people do it but I personally don’t think its good, it should just all be under one umbrella. I think there’s room for all types of dubstep and I would prefer to see more line-up’s that were diverse as well, that has a bit of everything that dubstep has to offer. I think the sub genres are just confusing and restricting as a producer, I make music that I like, that I would call dubstep.”_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n_\\[May 28th update: I figured I should clarify what I mean by \"post-dubstep\", because I realize that some people attribute it to a more specific sound and era, namely the kind of rnb/dubstep stuff of 2009-2012 from the likes of James Blake, Jamie xx and Sbtrkt. To me, I refer as post-dubstep all of the hybrid era of 2007-2012 (which includes the rnb-ish stuff).]_\n\n//\n\nAt the turn of the decade, dubstep was in a weird place. Confusion happened. While Mary Ann Hobbs' curated _Dubstep Warz_ and Digital Mystikz' _Essential Mix_ had rallied a new set of fans behind the dubstep banner in 2006 (introducing a global audience of music geeks to what seemed back then like the first, great new genre of the 21st century), it wasn't long until different new takes on the classic sound started to enter the scene. To give a couple of examples: In 2007, two of the biggest electronic releases, [_Untrue_ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHtNPzaHO7k)and [_FabricLive 37_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGNvjEuZzN4), were presented to the world as “dubstep”; in 2008, producers like [Joker ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ8pWDj3AX0)and Gemmy showed off their neon-lit, g-funk-influenced gloss painted over the classic dubstep sound; in 2009, the popularity of Joy Orbison's “[Hyph Mngo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa_PDKKc2_A)” (re)introduced a great number of people to the _garridge_ pulse... within the dubstep scene.\n\nOf course, the _FabricLive 37_ wobblefest, wub wub style would quickly become its own thing entirely, evolving into the “transformers” brostep sound that would spearhead the global EDM/Rave explosion of '09-'10 (and quickly be dismissed by critics, hipsters, dubsteppers and some older ravers). Everything else, though, seemed to live within the same space (or within the same network). As the quotes above suggest, since about 2007, people were contesting dubstep's South London/Croydon hegemony. A new wave occurred: new and old labels like Hessle Audio, Hotflush, 3024, Punch Drunk, Apple Pips, Hyperdub started to dive into this “post-dubstep” hybrid sound, where 2-step garage, house, techno, idm, jungle, hip hop, footwork/juke etc, etc could be thrown into the genre that had come out of the FWD>> club night.  \n\nBut “post-dubstep” is not a genre, nor was it an organized movement under that banner. It was a term used by fans, critics and bloggers to point to this ambiguous territory that certain artists had entered, taking those mentioned genres and passing them through the filter of dubstep synthesis. Stylistically, it was peripheral to dubstep (i.e. Deep Medi, Tempa, Boka, Osiris Music, Tectonic, Contagious, Ringo, etc), but it also became a central point of interest since music publications like Pitchfork, Fact Mag and Resident Advisor certainly took a great liking to it and hyped it. So the Pitchfork hipster reader that was spellbound by Shackleton's Fabric 55 and Martyn's Fabric 50, probably wasn't too bothered by Deep Medi's output or Youngsta's _Minimal Mondays_ on Rinse. The dubstep heads (even new ones like me) were most likely listening to all of it.\n\nIt was dubstep, but it wasn't dubstep. \n\nWas it “UK bass? Or was it “post-dubstep”? \n\n“And what about this new 'future garage' thing?” \n\nIt was confusing times, but that confusion was the result of the exciting concentrated surge of creativity that was happening then (mostly in London and Bristol). It was the start of this new ambiguity of “what do we call this?” and quasi-scene(s) that has defined underground UK bass music in the 2010s, where artists consciously avoid being pigeonholed into a clear-cut, defined genre and scene. I'm mostly thinking of the techno-and-electro-via-dubstep's-loose-sine-wave pushed by labels like Livity Sound, Timedance, Mistry, Tempa (at one point), Kaizen, Swamp 81, Jelly Bean Farm, Durkle Disco, Hessle Audio, Wisdom Teeth, Berceuse Heroique (to a certain extent), Hemlock, Whities etc. All of them promoting versatile music that can fit into any sort of techno set these days, but which, at least to my ears, owes a lot to this post-dubstep era (or maybe even exists because of it).\n\nI wouldn't be thinking about all of this this if it wasn't for D1's music, which I came across again through Youtube. But it wasn't the darkside, Youngsta-approved stuff that held my attention. It was his lighter side, like the sunny 2-stepper “Atmosphere”, the old school house chords and rave stabs of “Jus Business”, and the bubbly and emotive rollage of “Joy”. Music that he'd been making during this post-dubstep era, but which was never referenced within that framework; upon listening to it, could've found its place within it.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nPart of the classic dubstep vanguard, D1 was sneaking into the FWD>> night at the age of 15, soaking up the dark and dubby garage mutations of Horsepower Productions, Zed Bias, El-B and whatever DJ Hatcha would play (mostly the earliest Skream and Benga dubplates). He would go to the now-closed Black Market Records shop where he became friends with one of its employees, Daniel Lockhart aka DJ Youngsta, who encouraged him to get into production. In 2004, at the age of 16, he signed with the pioneering label Tempa; and his “Crack Bong” would be released on an EP alongside tracks from big names Kode9, Geeneus and El-B and new faces Loefah and Mala. He would form an alliance with Youngsta, who gave him pointers into how to perfect his sound according to his own vision (which culminated with the _Dubstep Allstars 2_ mix cd) and who presumably had first dibs on D1's fresh unreleased dubplates. His style became an important contribution to the formation of the South London sound (even though he came from West London): the dark and dubby,  Croydon dreadstep which would submerge FWD>> attendees in overwhelming subbass. One of his own tracks would serve as the opener to the Dubstep Warz one-off special broadcasted on BBC Radio 1 in 2006.\n\nD1 grew up in a musical family and learned to play the piano and the saxophone at a very young age. Maybe because he approached his beat-making in terms of chord progressions and harmony, and because he had a wide range musical interests, he grew weary of the classic sound that he had helped shape and personally felt like he'd become creatively stagnant. He sought to take a more “melodic” approach to the “140 bpm sound”. By 2008, his creative partnership with Tempa and Youngsta came to an end and he joined Caspa's Dub Police/Sub Soldiers crew, where he experimented with a dubstep sound inspired by Diplo, Redlight, old school rave, and house (à la Herve and Switch from the Dubsided label).\n\nHis joining of the Dub Police label was, stylistically at least, a weird one. Caspa (also a FWD>> attendee since the early days) had already begun his transition towards the brostep sound with his label, while D1, who occasionally made the odd wobble tune here and there, mostly dabbled into this “brighter” style. Brostep was aggressive and very macho with a I-don't-give-a-fuck ethos. D1's music was heavy, yes, but it was more “groove-based”, rhythmically intricate, putting his percussive flair to great use without any sign of macho-ism or aggression; instead it could have melancholic and emotive melodic sensibilities. Sometimes his synths have a weightless, ethereal yet euphoric quality to them, like if they had been taken from an ambient house, idm or, even, a new age record. According to D1 himself,  the opening track of this mix, “Identify”, “felt like trying to make trance”. It was a hint of things to come from the West London producer.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nThis showcase mix was made to put D1's melodic “140 sound” side by side with “post-dubstep” music to shape a diverse-yet-uniform vibe. His tracks in this mix come from his late-Tempa output, his Dub Police material, and from a batch of freebies released through Hedmuk's blog (neatly put in playlists by a kind Youtube user). I tried to get a wide range of artists and labels that would fit in this mix, without breaking the flow too much. We've got Martyn, Brackles, TRG (Cosmin' TRG, that is) and Peverelist doing neo-Detroit-via-UK vibes on the 3024 label, Appleblim's Apple Pips label, Ben UFO's and Pearson Sound's Hessle Audio, and Pev's own Punch Drunk. Also from Punch Drunk is Hyetal's and Shortstuff's (aka Mickey Pearce) sugary-sweet take on the purple sound. Addison Groove (aka Headhunter) comes through with the drum-machine Juke sound on Swamp 81. Untold's weird little number, “Gonna Work Out Fine” from his own label Hemlock, is an early sign of the extreme-percussion-ponctuation that will show up in underground club/uk bass/deconstructed circles throughout the 2010s (even Scratcha's recent Soul Destroyer remix of Basstone). That's preceded by a Night Slugs jam in Bok Bok and Cubic Zirconia's “Reclash (Dub)”. And, finally, I included a track from one of his Dub Police label-mates, Emalkay: the overlooked gem and b-side to “When I Look At You”, “A.G.S. (Angie Got Stoned)”.\n\nBut this mix is also, for me, a chance to reminisce about those times. You see, dubstep was my first love in electronic music, and I first got into it, earnestly, when all this nonsense was going on. A few months ago, when I first heard D1's “3d Sense” and “Mk 66” from the freebies pack, then discovered everything else from this mix (except “Identify”, I was already well familiar with that one), I was immediately transported back to 8-10 years ago when I discovered all these dubstep/post-dubstep sounds,  when I would listen to it on Youtube and Grooveshark until 3-4 am, downloading Rinse podcasts (the former pirate radio station had just got its licnse) and putting them on my non-Apple mp3 player, and listening to them on the bus with shit headphones on my way to the Cégep (and on the trip home, of course). I still hadn't gone to a club yet, so that was how I experienced this music back then. And I loved every second. Some of it holds up, some of it doesn't. Maybe some of it (post-dubstep) was contrived, but it was certainly a breath of fresh air after spending about 2 years listening to jazzy hip hop instrumentals from Japanese producers and US beat-tapes (Oh No, Madlib, J Dilla) and not being familiar at the time with jungle, dnb, techno, idm, garage, house.\n\nSo I hope you enjoy. Some of these D1 tracks (“Joy”, “Identify”, “Forever remix”) are some of my favourites from the dubstep diaspora in general\n. And while I do hope some of you will feel some nostalgia for this music, for the love of God, I also hope no one starts \"bringing it back\". There's enough revivalism as is.\n\n_\\*\\*Check bottom of article for additional links_\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/621429525&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<Tracklist tracksStr={[{\"startTime\":\"00:00\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Identify (Tempa)\"},{\"startTime\":\"4:08\",\"artist\":\"Martyn\",\"trackName\":\"Twenty Four (3024)\"},{\"startTime\":\"6:10\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"3rd Sense (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"8:55\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Organ Grinder (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"12:07\",\"artist\":\"Bok Bok & Cubic Zirconia\",\"trackName\":\"Reclash (Dub) (Night Slugs)\"},{\"startTime\":\"14:24\",\"artist\":\"Untold \",\"trackName\":\"Gonna Work Out Fine (Hemlock)\"},{\"startTime\":\"16:00\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Cave (Tempa)\"},{\"startTime\":\"18:44\",\"artist\":\"TRG\",\"trackName\":\"Broken Heart (Hessle Audio)\"},{\"startTime\":\"20:55\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Joy (Tempa)\"},{\"startTime\":\"25:08\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"I'm Lovin' (Dub Police)\"},{\"startTime\":\"26:58\",\"artist\":\"Brackles\",\"trackName\":\"Lizards (Apple Pips)\"},{\"startTime\":\"28:50\",\"artist\":\"Peverelist\",\"trackName\":\"Not Yet Further Than (Punch Drunk)\"},{\"startTime\":\"31:30\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Jus Business (Dub Police)\"},{\"startTime\":\"33:30\",\"artist\":\"Emalkay\",\"trackName\":\"A.G.S (Angie Got Stoned) (Dub Police)\"},{\"startTime\":\"36:30\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Mk 66 (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"38:40\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"All in Da Swing (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"40:40\",\"artist\":\"Addison Groove\",\"trackName\":\"Dumbshit (Swamp 81)\"},{\"startTime\":\"42:32\",\"artist\":\"Hyetal & Shortstuff\",\"trackName\":\"Ice Cream (Punch Drunk)\"},{\"startTime\":\"45:30\",\"artist\":\"Conquest\",\"trackName\":\"Forever (D1 Remix) (Dub Police)\"}]} />\n\n//\n\n_Both freebies packs are available on Youtube playlists.

And I've conveniently put some of it in this mix.","body":"Well, 2018 is officially behind us now. It's done and done. Looking back, I think we aught to say that it was yet another great year for music. And I've been able to document some of it, here at The Next Groove. At mid-year, I made [a list](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181201_list-current-favourite-mixes-of-2018) of my favourite mixes of the year up until that point. Then, I made myself a scorching-hot [dancehall playlist](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_reggae-gold-no-ragga-song-spesh), the _Ragga Song Spesh_, that served as a substitute for this year's lacking Reggae Gold release, and also for the defunct Ragga Ragga Ragga compilation series. Later on, we took a look at this year's excellent [Drum n Bass compilations](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181126_the-past-is-now-drum-n-bass-edition) (from the old-school to the forward thinking). And finally, a month ago now, I compiled my [ten favourite mixes](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181206_the-new-hardcore-part-deux) that represent what the UK Hardcore Sound currently is.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, it was but a tiny contribution. But seeing as those types of music are largely ignored by writers, critics, journalists, etc, from the hip sites and zines, I'm more than happy to have done my part in documenting what 2018 had the best to offer, however small a part it was. Mostly, we should be thanking all of the Youtube and Soundcloud channels, online music shops, and specialized music forums and subreddits that help us in discovering new music and in keeping track of everything.\n\nWhile I had thought that my last list would be the only “look-back” that I'd make, putting it together really gave me the itch to make another entry to the Showcase Mixes series. This one, a 23-track, hour-long overview of some my favourite electronic music of 2018.\n\n# The Mix\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"2018 Favourites\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/555227394&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\n\\*tracklist available at end of article\n\nUnlike my previous entries, this one isn't focused on one particular artist or genre. Instead, I selected from the whole diaspora of the “130 sound” of current UK Bass/Hardcore music. (Which I talk about in [this article](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_uk-techno-bass-percussion-bass-hard-drums-the-new-hardcore)). However, these aren't necessarily my absolute favourite tracks from that sound. A lot of them had to be added, cut, re-added, re-cut, etc. Two important things were also taken into account: 1) variety, and 2) the flow of the mix. \n\nThis past year, I was a regular listener of Livity Sound's monthly 2-hour shows on NTS Radio. Peverelist, the label boss, who's usually behind the decks for the first hour, likes to start things off with mellow, dubby tracks. I do the same as him here, easing things in with Henry Greenleaf's “In Same”, Patrick Flint's “Lean In” and M//R's “Among the Methods”: syncopated, minimalist, bass-heavy, dubby goodness. The mix then picks up with some tracks from old favourites (Peverelist and Lamont) and new discoveries (R.O.S.H. and Yaleesa Hall). The remixes for Museum's “The List” - a muscular, weighty Techno track with deformed LFOs – and Jonny L's classic “Piper” - with Peverelist's signature offbeat, bouncy subbass – are definitely in my top 10 of 2018 (if I had to make a list of individual tracks).\n\nThe midpoint mellows in a bit with Hodge's and Ishan Sound trap and grime influenced, cloud-y Dubstep beat, before Bash & T's (aka Julio Bashmore & T.Williams) deep Funky track, “EC”, picks up the energy again to start the second part of the mix, focusing on the more percussive end of the “130 sound” - from UK Funky, to Gqom (“Going Modd”), to Hard Drum (“Airplane Mode” and “2nd Guessing”), to a more tribal affair that recalls early-Dubstep (Szare's “Miner”), to anything in-between that can't be precisely classified. Finally the mix ends two ravey cuts: Mark Force's remix of Roska's classic UK Funky track “Feeline”; and JABES' heavy and ethereal “iKEA SUMMERS”. Both of them, again, unclassifiable.\n\nI'm happy with the mix, overall. It's representative of my current tastes, and it should give listeners a good idea of where underground bass and electronic club music is headed right now.\n\n**Tracklist**\n\n0:00 - Henry Greenleaf - In Same\n\n3:00 - Patrick Flint - Lean In\n\n5:56 - M//R - Among the Methods\n\n9:03 - Appleblim - Vurstep (Shed Remix)\n\n11:56 - R.O.S.H. - Will I Make the Turn\n\n15:26 - Jonny L - Piper (Peverelist Remix)\n\n17:41 - Museum - The List (Yaleesa Hall Remix)\n\n20:56 - Lamont - Dope\n\n23:56 - Sensei - Tension\n\n27:56 - Hodge & Ishan Sound - C5\n\n30:10 - Bash & T - EC\n\n32:41 - Ice Viper - Perfect Swimmer\n\n33:56 - DJ Lag & Epic B - Going Modd\n\n36:04 - Mistareez - Residue\n\n38:30 - Neana - Neans Anthem\n\n41:21 - Akito & Famous Eno - Airplane Mode\n\n42:45 - Martyn Bootyspoon - Steam\n\n44:17 - Noire - 2nd Guessin'\n\n47:00 - Lava Dome - Closer (Galtier Remix)\n\n48:50 - Akito - Wake Me Up in Paris\n\n51:00 - Szare - Miner\n\n52:30 - Roska - Feeline (Mark Force Remix)\n\n54:50 - JABES - iKEA SUMMERS","name":"20190107_-some-favourites-of-2018","urlPath":"/article/20190107_-some-favourites-of-2018"},{"publicationDate":"Oct 04, 2018","title":"Old School House Music (made in the 21st Century)","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/showhouse.jpg","category":"MIXES","summary":"This Showcase Mix entry is comprised of some song-based House music that I've been feeling a lot lately. 21st Century House music with an old school vibe!","body":"Consider this statement: \"Jungle has House influences\".\n\nYou say: \"Ok...\"\n\nAlso consider: \"Jungle also has Techno influences.\"\n\nAnd you might be left wondering: What, exactly, is House? What, exactly, is Techno? And how can people distinguish one from the other?\n\nLet me try and give a description. Techno is _machine music_. Usually instrumental, it has a steady, repetitive rhythm; it's not too slow, but not too fast. It can sound grey and atonal, or even, at times, bright and melodic. Created in the 80s in Detroit, it takes massive influences from West Coast P-Funk and 70s German electronic music, taking the German motorik pulse and putting it in a dance/club environment.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\nKraftwerk's **Die Roboter \\[The Robot]**, an example of German electronic music\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Die Roboter [The Robot]\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUW_6YkMRF8\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\nRobert Hood's **Detroit: One Circle**, an example of Detroit Techno\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Robert Hood - Detrot: One Circle\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uH7u1ZeRK34\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd House? Well, House is also dance/club music with a steady, repetitive rhythm (not too fast, not too slow) created with the help of drum-machines. But House is _soul music_. Originating in Chicago, sometime in the late 70s, its sound stems from the long tradition of R'n'B. While Chicago House is usually instrumental, and can be stripped back like Techno, it has an evident Funk and Disco groove to it. The Garage House variant from New York, also from the late 70s, is more song-based, with its Disco, Soul and R'n'B (and even Jazz) influences made much more apparent.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Patti LaBelle - It's Alriht With Me\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iHgzxHwGdCw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Marshall Jefferson - Move Your Body\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwhE9g7r9qU\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Soundstream - All Night\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0Z8FUYUkZ0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nOf course, Techno and House, despite its purists, have always co-existed and, in turn, influenced each other. Some tracks could be categorized as both, making things frustrating for people who need to have things neatly classified. But I can confidently say that Robert Hood's classic \"Detroit: One Circle\" is unquestionably Techno, and that Marshall Jefferson's and Soundstream's posted tracks are indeed House, through and through.\n\nAt this point, House music is already about 4 decades old, and there seems to be no sign of it slowing down. For four decades, with all of the stylistic changes it has gone through, it is essentially the same thing. Same vibe. Same formula. Even now there are still masses of House producers sampling Jazz, Funk, R'n'B and Disco records (some even specializing in making Edits of old Disco joints): A testament to how the genre has stuck to its roots, to its musical heritage, and, to a certain extent, to its original sound. House music has, in my opinion, become a classical genre. \"Classical\" in the sense that it has its own unchanged, traditional conventions that are able to host new and foreign elements without having them alter the essence of its sound. While I'm the type of listener that likes to look for the new (and that is in perpetual search for the new), it is impossible no to commend its long-lasting appeal, and how much great music this genre continues to give.\n\n## The Mix\n\nSo, for this showcase mix, I thought I'd make one with House tracks that are more \"song-based\", for every listener that has also wondered what House music is.  Well, this is it. This is No Nonsense House Music. 4-4-2 House Music. \"Just Punt the Ball Away!\" House Music. Pepperoni and Pizza House Music. No fusion elements. No generic ambiguity. No musical hybridity with new, current genres, or Techno, or anything else. Just a steady rhythm with funky basslines, jazzy chords on synthesizers, upbeat piano, Disco-styled strings, soulful R'n'B singers, and divas.\n\nThe music here falls more in line with the New York Garage version of House. And to offer something different from the classics that we hear over and over again, I thought I'd select tracks made after 2000 that have an old school feel. If the track is relatively recent, and if Larry Levan would've probably liked it, then it's going in. I hope you enjoy.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n**_♪♪ 'Cause House is a feeling! ♪♪_**\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Soulful House Showcase Mix\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/509637738&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nTracklist:\n\n* _00:00_\n  * Quentin Harris - My Joy\n* _04:21_\n  * Full Intention - I'll Be Waiting (Gray & Pearn Remix)\n* 07:48\n  * Hardsoul feat.

Do you remember when Nights Slugs sounded like the future? When Future Garage was still a thing? When the Butterz crew initiated the \"Grime Revival\"? When Marcell Detmann and Ben Klock were making techno cool again? When the aggro, \"bro\" side of Dubstep spearheaded the global takeover of festival EDM culture?\n\nA last one: Do you remember when Swamp 81 was one of the coolest, trendiest labels and crews in underground electronic music?\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nSwamp 81 was founded in the late 2000s by DMZ member and Dubstep pioneer, Loefah. Discouraged by the direction the genre had taken, he started his new label in order to push a sound that aligned itself more with his tastes. The first few releases - notably from Kryptic Minds - are characterized by a return to Dubstep's \"roots\" (the noisy, aggressive sound was overtaking the scene by then) : the dark and minimal, halftime style.\n\nBut the label took a sudden turn in 2010 with its 5th release: **Addison Groove**'s (aka **Headhunter**) 12\" record with \"Footcrab\" (and \"Dumbshit\" on the B-side). It became an immediate hit in the underground. The Juke-inspired, lo-fi, bassy, drum-machine track sounded like nothing else in Dubstep.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Addison Groove - Footcrab\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWfiog1Ure4\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nThe British had just discovered (or re-discovered) America's \"Ghetto Bass\" music from the 90s: Starting with Juke and Footwork, then with Ghettotech and Ghetto House; all from Detroit and Chicago. Also worth mentioning, Trap's 808-infused beats was beginning its ascension right about then.\n\nQuickly, Loefah's interests shifted towards this \"drum-machine\" styled bass music, exploring the past while trying to push fresh, new sounds. Hyped by the two most influential music journals in underground electronic music, Fact Magazine and Resident Advisor, the label also became an influential force. In the early 2010s, Loefah was joined by like-minded producers such as the Hessle Audio co-founder Ramadanman (now known as Pearson Sound), Addison Groove, Mickey Pearce, UK Garage legend Zed Bias, Paleman, Joy Orbison...\n\nAnd, of course, **Boddika**.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nBoddika's musical origins are in Drum N Bass, as one-half of** Instra:mental**. The duo was active in the 2000s, initially pushing a sound reminiscent of Metalheadz, and collaborating with Drum N Bass pioneers and heroes, Source Direct and Jonny L. It was good music, but it wasn't anything that distinguished itself from what had been done, and what was being done, in the genre. However, by the end of the decade, they started to explore a more moody, emotional and sometimes cinematic side to their style. Throughout 2009, Jon Convex (aka Kid Drama), the other half of Instra:mental, did a series of podcasts with D-Bridge, taking this style further and further. It came to be known as the \"Autonomic\" sound, which was the name of the podcast.\n (A great write-up of this is done [here](https://godisnolongeradj.wordpress.com/2017/01/25/tracks-i-wish-id-written-issue-8-instramental-photograph/))\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Instra:mental - Sakura\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Kp_0kiSKaA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nThe duo also ventured out of Drum N Bass, going into Electro, Techno and House territory,  dropping all the way down to the 130-140 bpm range. Their last big hurrah before their split was a career-defining LP,** Resolution 653**, released in 2011, in which they leaned towards an experimental Electro and Techno sound. By then, they had fully assumed a \"drum-machine\" sound,  taking it to its extremes. Although the duo split, Boddika made this sound his own. In Swamp 81, he found a place were he could foster it. (He also released music on other labels such as Sunklo, \\[NakedLunch], and his own Nonplus+.)\n\n## The Mix\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Boddika Showcase Mix\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/487023597&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n_The tracklist is at the end of the article._\n\nThis showcase starts with two Instra:mental tracks, \"Forbidden\" and \"Futurist\", in order to establish a contrast with the rest of the mix. The first one, while being in the 130 bpm range, is incredibly reminiscent of Boddika's Drum N Bass roots. The second is a good example of the \"Autonomic\" vibe they were doing. Notice how, in \"Forbidden\", the production has a warm tone to it: it's very clean-sounding and polished. In \"Futurist\", their goal is to create a sort of moody reverie, with a \"lush\" production style. Then, \"Faint\", a collaboration with two Swamp 81 label-mates, goes straight into what I call \"Drum-Machine Music\", as practiced by Boddika and the rest of Don Loefah' crew.\n\nGenerally, in electronic music , the machines (or the plug-ins) used to create the music  are tools that serve a whole. Each sound emitted by these machines are building blocks for a composition. Especially now, and recently, everything has to be \"polished\", rounded. The aesthetic is the mood this \"whole\", the composition, creates. \n\nBut with Boddika, the machine is the aesthetic. The machine manifests itself, calls attention to itself. Its textures and artificiality are made evident. Notice the raw, unpolished drum sounds throughout the mix, and the sharp hi-hats. Almost all of the drum sounds are dry (\"dry\" as in \"no reverb at all\"). In \"Rubba\", even the snares are ridiculously snappy. If UK Garage was all about off-beat swing, then Boddika has the _swing _dial turned all the way down. It's as if his beat patterns are limited to what an old drum-machine's interface is able to do. The music sounds very \"modern\", but, like listening to an old Electro track, it's incredibly obvious that a machine is making this sound.\n\nThis \"drum-machine\" approach affects everything. Notice the synths, how they're shaped into twisted, sometimes atonal, forms, going in and out through clumsily applied filters and dials, having a life of their own,  and almost ignoring the notion of harmony. Just like the hi-hats, they're razor-sharp and direct. \"You Tell Me\" takes this aesthetic to its extreme, with its off-key melodies and the ear-bleeding LFOs being torn apart. And notice the drum-machine jam that is** \"**Beats Me\", in which the backing speech sample (a sensual voice like in an old Chicago House track) is manipulated and deformed as to become incomprehensible. Again, it's the machine, the artificial nature of the music, that is highlighted. It directs and informs the composition.\n\nAll of this is done deliberately. As we have seen, Boddika is able to create a \"polished\" sound if he wants to. But his goal, in the early 2010s, was to create raw and immediate beats, influenced by American \"Ghetto Bass\" music and the UK Hardcore's fixation on the groove (percussion and bass dynamic).\n\nThe mix ends with the one-two punch assault of \"In Here\" and \"More Maim\". Both were released in 2014 on the same 12\" record on Sunklo (his and Joy Orbison's label where they released their collaborations). And both represent, at least for me, the end of Boddika's drum-machine era. Since then, he has transitioned into to a more by-the-numbers techno sound, focusing on releasing other people's music on his own Nonplus+ label.\n\nThis aesthetic in dance music isn't exclusive to him. Of course, he takes it to another level, but it's an approach others have also done, whether in [Dancehall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4KFkgloz0k), in [House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfpoXeOnfbg), or [Dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cWgvo6TtZQ). The Swamp 81 crew were simply some of the practitioners.\n\nTracklist:\n\n<SpecialText align=\"undefined\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\n* _00:00_\n  * Instra:mental - Forbidden (Apple Pips)\n* _02:57 _\n  * Instra:mental - Futurist (NakedLunch)\n* _05:32_\n  * Joy Orbison, Boddika & Pearson Sound - Faint (Sunklo)\n* _06:46_\n  * Boddika - Crack (Swamp 81)\n* _08:44_\n  * Boddika - Syn Chron (NakedLunch)\n* _11:12_\n  * Boddika - 2727 (Swamp 81)\n* _14:00_\n  * Boddika - Basement (Swamp 81)\n* _15:47 _\n  * Boddika - You Tell Me (Nonplus)\n* _19:26_\n  * Boddika - Beats Me (Nonplus)\n* _21:00_\n  * Boddika - Rubba (Swamp 81)\n* _23:37_\n  * Joy Orbison & Boddika - In Here (Sunklo)\n* _26:20_\n  * Joy Orbison & Boddika - More Maim (Sunklo)\n\n![The man himself](/cms-content/uploads/boddika02.jpg)","name":"20181123_showcase-mix-boddika-s-drum-machine-music","urlPath":"/article/20181123_showcase-mix-boddika-s-drum-machine-music"},{"publicationDate":"Aug 15, 2018","title":"Mala's Bass Mutations","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/mala.jpg","category":"MIXES","summary":"Although his music continues to be revered in the underground Dubstep scene, Mala's music still sounds unlike anything else in it. ","body":"Earlier in the year, Red Bull Music wrote an article, stating: \"[Why dubstep is back at the cutting edge in 2018](https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/dubstep-back-at-cutting-edge)\".\n\nAnd Plastician, one of the scene's originators, thinks it might be [flourishing soon](https://twitter.com/Plastician/status/969288617880375296), or even right now.\n\nEver since the Brostep explosion dissipated and the style was relegated to the margins of the EDM/Festival culture, the underground Dubstep scene, keeping the spirit of the original sound alive, kept trudging on. The \"Dungeon Sound\" came and went. Soon after, around four years ago or so, a new school of producers started playing with new sound palettes, taking cues from other genres like Halftime Drum n Bass, Riddim, Grime, and Trap, but always staying within the familiar template. The music is essentially the same: stripped-back, spaced-out beats.; leftfield inclinations; nd, of course, a hefty, low-end subbass. All at around 140 bpm.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Chokez - Konichiwa\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8WeM7iVank\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd while this new school has brought some needed freshness to the genre, the strict adherence to the halftime beat pattern  (i.e. accentuated first and third beat on every measure; typically with a kick on the first and a snare on the third) makes me wish that there was more rhythmic variety. The underground Dubstep scene has always given itself the mandate of \"keeping the original sound alive\", while worshiping the early players. But, ironically, rhythmic variety is a lesson they could draw from the early days, from before everyone and their mothers started doing the halftime beat.\n\nEnter **Mala**.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Mala is one half of the Digital Mystikz (the other half being his childhood friend, Coki). With their other two friends  (Loefah and Sgt Pokes), they formed DMZ - a crew, a label and, eventually, a club night. This South London quartet has always been given the credit in having the biggest part in shaping the Dubstep sound. I don't think that's entirely accurate, but, certainly, when it comes to that older era, no one is more celebrated than them.\n\n![The DMZ gang](/cms-content/uploads/mala02.jpg)\n\nWhile Mala isn't my favourite producer from that time (that would be either Loefah or D1), I feel that his discography gives a great glimpse into why Dubstep was such a great genre in its genesis. I think now is a good time to revisit Mala's early Dubstep explorations (from around 2003-5).\n\nDubstep hadn't yet become formulaic back then. There were two rules: around 140 bpm (emphasis on \"around\") and subbass. That was it. People brought they're own styles to the table. Influences ranged from UK Garage - notably its 2-Step variant (hence the \"step\" in \"dubstep) - , Jungle, Drum n Bass, Minimal Techno, Broken Beat, Dancehall and Dub Reggae.\n\nMala and Loefah have stated in interviews that, at the time, they were simply looking for something new, something fresh and exciting. It wasn't necessarily to invent or come up with a new genre, but to participate in a scene that encouraged new ideas, at a time when Drum N Bass, UK Garage, House and Techno had become, according to them, creatively stagnant.\n\n# The mix\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mala Showcase Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=%2Fmordak%2Fmala-showcase-mix%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nSo here's a showcase mix of Mala's music. A selection of some of my favourite beats of his that, I feel, give a good idea of his overall sound. Also note that a lot of tracks were released under the \"Digital Mystikz\" moniker, but the duo rarely produced tracks together. These are all Mala productions.\n _(*a tracklist is provided at the end of the article)_\n\nHis drum sounds have an earthy tone to them, sometimes even going for a tribal feel. Compared to almost all electronic music, they lack a certain polish, but their _rawness _gives them a lot of character, a lot of grit. They're accompanied by shuffling, offbeat hi-hats and an array of percussive sounds. And all of that is propelled by a subbass made for sound systems.\n\nThe music is dark and haunting; meditative and apocalyptic. Notice the melancholic instrumental samples paired with the Jah/rastafarian vocals. And notice the ominous piano notes in **Bury Da Bwoy**. But Mala's groove gives it a dynamic energy that still sounds unique, and that works for both the skankers at the rave and the head nodders listening at home.\n\nThe second half  of the mix, especially, showcases the rhythmic variety that Mala practices. Notice how in tracks like **Neverland**, **Awake** and **Da Wrath**, it isn't the first and third beats of every measure that are accentuated. The music has more of a \"jump-up\" feel rather than a halftime one.\n\nTracks like **Conference** and **Walkin' With Jah** go into some warped, tribal affair and broken beat patterns. The former making use of hand-slapped afro-percussion samples. And the latter, using the sounds of distant, rolling tribal drums, and all of it backed-up by a gurgling, cavernous subbass leading to atonal strings.\n\nIn the early 2000s, music like this made people think about what rave music could be, and what electronic music could be. By revisiting early Dubstep, even the current players could think about what Dubstep can be, and, I hope, free themselves from the stranglehold of the formulaic halftime beat pattern.\n\nLastly, Mala's music, putting the emphasis on the percussion and bass, also fits with the current trend of \"Percussion/Bass\" music of the underground UK scene, showing how the same sort of musical tendencies, elements and ideas can come out in new genres with fresh results. Anyone who enjoys the current tribal and percussive sound should find something that they like in, not only Mala's, but early Dubstep's body of work.\n\n<Tracklist tracksStr={[{\"startTime\":\"00:00\",\"artist\":\"Mala\",\"trackName\":\"Changes\"},{\"startTime\":\"04:36\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Misty Winter\"},{\"startTime\":\"07:02\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Chainba\"},{\"startTime\":\"09:22\",\"artist\":\"Mala\",\"trackName\":\"Bury Da Bwoy\"},{\"startTime\":\"11:54\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Neverland\"},{\"startTime\":\"14:53\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Awake\"},{\"startTime\":\"18:06\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Conference\"},{\"startTime\":\"20:50\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Da Wrath\"},{\"startTime\":\"23:07\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Walkin' with Jah\"},{\"startTime\":\"26:00\",\"artist\":\"Mala\",\"trackName\":\"Alicia\"}]} />","name":"20181201_malas-bass-mutations","urlPath":"/article/20181201_malas-bass-mutations"}],"links":{"previousPage":null,"nextPage":null}}
