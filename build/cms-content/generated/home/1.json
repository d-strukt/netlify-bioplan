Why? At first I thought it was because I felt that the scenes and genres that I was following were sort of going around in circles, directionless; that maybe the lack of apparent collective movement, of an overarching narrative in music had started to bore me. Maybe. But I think the likelier reason was that I had simply reached a point of satiety with music, no doubt a result of listening to too much of it.\n\nI hadn't abandoned it completely though. And I think I'm starting to fall back into my usual listening habits.\n\nAnyways, this is some of what I've been enjoying these last few weeks.\n\nToasty!  Toastyboy! Very little is know of him, a faceless producer of which little is known. A practitioner of the 2000s' breakstep sound, he made some noise with his releases on Scuba's Hotflush label, back when Scuba was part of the dubstep/140 bpm scene. Toasty's (Damien Russell according to [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/242531-Toasty)) music is very dear to me, mainly because it was one of my points of entry into the world of electronic music and UK rave, 10 years ago. But even then, it was clear to me that his production had a feel of its own, a mix of cinematic sensibilities from 90s electronica and idm, old school dark d'n'b rollers and garridge swing.\n\nHe had disappeared for the larger part of this decade, until his comeback in 2017 with his _Metal_ EP released on Circadian Rhythm's label. “Rebar”, dark and ethereal, instantly became one of my faves from that year.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Rebar\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bpTMLmHXE7k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n“Rebar” came out almost a decade after his previous official release, _On Something / You're Special_, brought to us by Slaughter Mob's Halo Beats label and, breaking away from the breaks sound and taking rhythmic influences from Mala, a delightful dubbier side to his music. Ben UFO was probably creaming himself all over this back then.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty / Toastyboy - On Something\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMTrdAJEhP8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nBut it's his halfstep banger from 2004, “Knowledge”, with which he left his mark. It's certainly his most direct track, adding his own twist to 90s diva and chipmunk vocals. But that snare, that glorious snare, is probably the most mid-2000s sound you'll hear today.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Knowledge\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-pLVMQxS54\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nAfter another two years of silence following _Metal_, Toasty came out of hiding again, back in April,  by opening his own Bandcamp page (as is usual these days) and posting mastered versions of previously-unreleased tracks. No surprises really, in terms of sound, but they definitely warrant a listen.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Unconcious\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3974819469/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://toasty.bandcamp.com/track/unconcious\">unconcious by toasty</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Strangedays\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2436096026/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://toasty.bandcamp.com/track/strangedays\">strangedays by toasty</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Toasty - Some Kind of Noise\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=385540344/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://toasty.bandcamp.com/track/some-kind-of-noise\">some kind of noise by toasty</a></iframe>} />\n\nMore can be listened to on his page: https://toasty.bandcamp.com/\n\nBreakstep is evidently the forgotten sister genre of the other two “140 bpm” genres, one that I don't know much about unfortunately. It shares some of the same roots as dubstep and, if it never drew much attention, it has to be because, at the end of the day, it was probably the most conservative of the three genres (the other being grime, of course).  When people speak and write about hearing dubstep for the first time in 2005-6 (thank you forums and archived blog posts), they almost always mention how they were very aware that they were listening to something new, something fresh. Breakstep was ultimately too stuck in the 90s. “Slowed-down drum n bass” is not an unfair descriptor. Nevertheless, there was some quality shit.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Elemental - 925\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KushotpeDlM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Quiet Storm (aka Caspa) - Tribute 10\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmUG6MAvOR4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Darqwan (aka Oris Jay) - Said the Spider\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HagDGlTCpWc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n♪\n\nContinuing on the theme of previously unreleased tracks showing up on Bandcamp this year, how about Lux Groove's “Five Four”? Current and former fans of DJ Youngsta might not recognize that name, but they might recognize the Swamp 81-styled drum machine bass jam that was part of Yunx' “130 sound” sets of 2013-2015. I don't remember in which interview he says this, but I do remember him mentioning how certain “130 sound” (i.e. techno and electro post-dubstep/UK bass hybrids) tracks reminded him of early dubstep. This is an example of such a track, showing up of the self-released [_Collections_](https://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections) __compilation. It's a slick track, stripped-back, with a rolling, cascading bass. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Lux Groove - Five Four\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2227437386/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2304879424/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections\">Collections by Lux Groove</a></iframe>} />\n\nIt reminds me in a way of Benga's early, early production. Like this little number:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Benga - Star Wars (Hatcha Dub)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hn1ZAlcXZrQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nAnd this unreleased one:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Benga - Skank VIP (Youngsta dubplate)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bh73nZqYmE?start=107\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nThere's more of these skeletal drum machine tracks in Lux Groove's release:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Lux Groove - Know You\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2227437386/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1857208060/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections\">Collections by Lux Groove</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Lux Groove - Seven\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2227437386/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1884250366/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://luxgroove.bandcamp.com/album/collections\">Collections by Lux Groove</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nWhere I'm currently residing, summer had come in full swing. These days, that means that we've just had to go through weeks of burning sunlight and sticky, humid air with some rain to bring people here some relief. Maybe like how some people tend to listen to more emo, Nick Drake or Radiohead during the fall, or to more extreme metal during the long winter nights, I think the recent weather drew me to Archie B's _Steppin Up Vol 1_ mix. Yeah, I know that deep tech's come and gone since a while now, but somehow his so-glossy-as-to-be-aquatic sound somehow seemed a fitting soundtrack for these few weeks.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Archie B - Steppin Up - Vol 1\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156643158&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd if you need more deep tech goodness, I recommend giving a listen to this mix of Dean Allen (of Studio 37) productions:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dean Allen (Studio 37) Tribute Mix - Compiled By: Theo 'Stretch' Lewis\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244798192&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nHis cold, nocturnal and skeletal beats a great contrast to Archie B's work:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Archie B - Give My All\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pV9u6_d06E\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Studio 37 - Warpath [Dean Allen production]\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PpUL8Ymed2Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />","name":"20190809_getting-back-into-the-swing-of-things","urlPath":"/article/20190809_getting-back-into-the-swing-of-things"},{"publicationDate":"May 18, 2019","title":"Imperial Selection","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/title-image-feast.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"Some quick thoughts, and going through my fave mixes and sets from the past few weeks.","body":"I don't know what happened. I don't know if everyone was particularly inspired during these past few weeks or that maybe I was particularly receptive, but a lot of damn good mixes and sets came out, and it's the first time I've cut some out. I meant to make this list a week before, but I got too caught up doing the D1 thing, which turned out to be longer than I had initially anticipated. \n\nI honestly don't have much commentary to make for this entry. As much good music as there was since my last list, there wasn't anything that came to mind as to the direction the music is going (or the lack thereof in this web 2.0-era of music experience). All I can say is: as we draw closer to the end of another decade, I've come to terms with the fact that we didn't witness the birth of a “big” new genre that would seem to captivate everyone at once. There's too much music-discovery-as-personal-experience, too much looking back, too much choice at any given moment for it to happen in electronic music right now\n\nWave? Future Bass? Gqom? Deconstructed Club? The latter has been using too many samples of movie effects and shattered drinking glasses, and become too _auteur­_-iste to be taken seriously outside of the “music geek”-sphere. (You need to attract the “non-artists”, the “anti-artist”, to drive in that heavy surge of “innocent” creativity, not just from the artsy crowd). Wave seemed incredibly uninspired the moment it was invented (in my experience, that would be around 2012-3; basically an offshoot of the dullest trap-influenced grime beats that Plastician was playing on his Rinse show at the time), but I've noticed that it's slowly (see:slowly) been picking up steam. The gqom originators have watered down their sound since the likes of mixmag accepted them into their ranks. That isn't intrinsically bad (in fact, I love some of the new stuff), but this has resulted in it being sucked into the global blob of afro/global bass/club  in the general consciousness.\n\nAnd what about juke? Well, I really like it, and I like that it's gotten a resurgence of interest lately with the “160” scene, but it didn't end up causing the disruption I hoped it would back in 2010.\n\nYep, this really was hip hop's decade. Hip hop is what gave us something close to \"new, visceral music as a collective experience”, starting with the whole mixtape-era of Atlanta trap and Chicago drill (and bop, to an extent), and going into the Future and Young Thug sound of autotuned alien-gangster stuff.  Kendrick Lamar's _To Pimp a Butterfly_ is probably the only album in these 10 years that has brought together an intersection of geeks, casual listeners, old hip hop heads and younger ones (Kanye's _Fantasy_ too, maybe). And some have been saying that UK drill is the genre currently channeling the energy of old school hardcore and jungle'(as opposed to the UK techno/bass and deconstructed club stuff).\n\nOk, maybe I had a thing or two to say. I'll stop there. \n\nDespite all this, the quality is still there. And this is what I think was the most exciting in mixes and sets since my last list. I'll start things off with the three must-listens.\n\nFirstly, a mix from March that I had missed. I would like to confirm that yes, DJ Stingray's Essential Mix is just as good as people have been saying. One of Europe's current Detroit ambassadors gives us essentially two hours of electro and techno slappers, showing us that there's still some goddamn funk left in Berlin. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Stingray - BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix (02-03-2019)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmjniDKIA1Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nFor some more dirty electro bidness, Galaxian, one of Stingray's past collaborators, gave the Hong Kong Community Radio a hell of a set - an intergalactic blast, a cosmic fuckfest, apocalypse-as-enlightenment, bass designed to mess up your insides. (check out his [incredible release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71k8xhbSUL4) from this year)\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Galaxian - 19/4/2019 (HKCR)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FHKCR%2Fgalaxian-1942019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nTo switch things up a bit (but not dial down in energy), Akito and Noire's set for NTS Radio in April. The Sans Absence label boss Akito, based in London, is doing everything right with his “percussively-focused club music” - or  “hard drum” as some might call. Or maybe “turbo funky” as I'd call it (stealing Fracture's “turbo dnb” term). I don't know what it's called, but this heavy, rave-y carnaval sound will make you want to slap ya mom up. Well, I'm mostly just glad that I'm getting into a new UK sound that has stepped out of the “dubstep synthesis” of UK bass, and that isn't treading water.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Akito - 5th April 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fakito-5th-april-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nSpeaking of “dubstep synthesis”, Henry Greenleaf's mix for Body Promise deserves an honorable mention amongst the previous three. While his peers are going more into leftfield or conventional-techno territories, the former dnb producer is holding it down with his style of UK techno that sometimes veers close to techno-via-hatcha-circa-2004. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf – Body Promise BP 118\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/602717451&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nFor more of those UK techno vibes, the Famous Eno collaborator from Mexico, Siete Catorce, has also done a mix for JEROME mixfiles on soundcloud. (https://soundcloud.com/jeromemixfileseries/jerome-mixfile-425-siete-catorce )\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nNow for some dnb/jungle.\n\nRupture London took over Keep Hush at the very end of March. The label has been repping the classic dark rollage dnb sound since its inception, and the Youtube channel has recreated the underground vibes that Boiler Room initially had 10 years ago. The pairing has resulted in incredible sets from Mantra and Mani Festo, both of them effortlessly bringing together the old and the new.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mantra DJ set | Keep Hush Live: Rupture Takeover\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIaL7xi_MAM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mani Festo DJ set | Keep Hush Live: Rupture Takeover\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-TF41HePaI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nFor more dark rollage, check out Dom & Roland intense 30-min mix for BBC Radio 1. It's essentially a  promo for his bandcamp page, so check it (https://domandroland.bandcamp.com/ ) out if you can. His new release from April is great – smooth yet heavy. (https://domandroland.bandcamp.com/album/beach-bum-dred-sound )\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dom & Roland BBC Radio 1 Guest Mix April 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/603350553&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nKeysound did an “All Vinyl ('94-'98 D&B)” set for their monthly show on Rinse. Expect the classic names like Photek, Doc Scott, Ed Rush & Optical and Krust. (https://soundcloud.com/rinsefm/keysound-25th-april-2019 )\n\n//\n\nSonic Rampage's Pearsall also did a great mix of new school old school, this time focusing on new tracks from artists that imitate the old “darkside” breakbeat and jungle vibe from '93. And he's shared some [great thoughts](http://sonicrampage.org/blog/2019/04/pearsall-presents-get-it-005-get-dark-new-skool-darkside-mix/) on this current retro-rave trend, as well as some [interesting discussion](http://sonicrampage.org/blog/2019/05/more-thoughts-on-get-dark/) from readers/listeners. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Pearsall presents Get It 005: Get Dark\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/610333344&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n//\n\nAnd lastly, for some new new school, definitely check out some “160” stuff that I mentioned, blending halftime, juke and jungle. London-based and Reprezent Radio resident Sherelle has been leading the charge on that front. And she invites Om Unit to provide a guest mix for his take on the sound.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Sherelle W/ Om Unit | 16th April 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FReprezent%2Fsherelle-w-om-unit-16th-april-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nAnd lastly lastly, Benny Ill shared a 2 hour-long session of 90s garage  (_garridge_ and _guhrahje_) through his twitter page to celebrate the coming of Spring.

To me, I refer as post-dubstep all of the hybrid era of 2007-2012 (which includes the rnb-ish stuff).]_\n\n//\n\nAt the turn of the decade, dubstep was in a weird place. Confusion happened. While Mary Ann Hobbs' curated _Dubstep Warz_ and Digital Mystikz' _Essential Mix_ had rallied a new set of fans behind the dubstep banner in 2006 (introducing a global audience of music geeks to what seemed back then like the first, great new genre of the 21st century), it wasn't long until different new takes on the classic sound started to enter the scene. To give a couple of examples: In 2007, two of the biggest electronic releases, [_Untrue_ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHtNPzaHO7k)and [_FabricLive 37_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGNvjEuZzN4), were presented to the world as “dubstep”; in 2008, producers like [Joker ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ8pWDj3AX0)and Gemmy showed off their neon-lit, g-funk-influenced gloss painted over the classic dubstep sound; in 2009, the popularity of Joy Orbison's “[Hyph Mngo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa_PDKKc2_A)” (re)introduced a great number of people to the _garridge_ pulse... within the dubstep scene.\n\nOf course, the _FabricLive 37_ wobblefest, wub wub style would quickly become its own thing entirely, evolving into the “transformers” brostep sound that would spearhead the global EDM/Rave explosion of '09-'10 (and quickly be dismissed by critics, hipsters, dubsteppers and some older ravers). Everything else, though, seemed to live within the same space (or within the same network). As the quotes above suggest, since about 2007, people were contesting dubstep's South London/Croydon hegemony. A new wave occurred: new and old labels like Hessle Audio, Hotflush, 3024, Punch Drunk, Apple Pips, Hyperdub started to dive into this “post-dubstep” hybrid sound, where 2-step garage, house, techno, idm, jungle, hip hop, footwork/juke etc, etc could be thrown into the genre that had come out of the FWD>> club night.  \n\nBut “post-dubstep” is not a genre, nor was it an organized movement under that banner. It was a term used by fans, critics and bloggers to point to this ambiguous territory that certain artists had entered, taking those mentioned genres and passing them through the filter of dubstep synthesis. Stylistically, it was peripheral to dubstep (i.e. Deep Medi, Tempa, Boka, Osiris Music, Tectonic, Contagious, Ringo, etc), but it also became a central point of interest since music publications like Pitchfork, Fact Mag and Resident Advisor certainly took a great liking to it and hyped it. So the Pitchfork hipster reader that was spellbound by Shackleton's Fabric 55 and Martyn's Fabric 50, probably wasn't too bothered by Deep Medi's output or Youngsta's _Minimal Mondays_ on Rinse. The dubstep heads (even new ones like me) were most likely listening to all of it.\n\nIt was dubstep, but it wasn't dubstep. \n\nWas it “UK bass? Or was it “post-dubstep”? \n\n“And what about this new 'future garage' thing?” \n\nIt was confusing times, but that confusion was the result of the exciting concentrated surge of creativity that was happening then (mostly in London and Bristol). It was the start of this new ambiguity of “what do we call this?” and quasi-scene(s) that has defined underground UK bass music in the 2010s, where artists consciously avoid being pigeonholed into a clear-cut, defined genre and scene. I'm mostly thinking of the techno-and-electro-via-dubstep's-loose-sine-wave pushed by labels like Livity Sound, Timedance, Mistry, Tempa (at one point), Kaizen, Swamp 81, Jelly Bean Farm, Durkle Disco, Hessle Audio, Wisdom Teeth, Berceuse Heroique (to a certain extent), Hemlock, Whities etc. All of them promoting versatile music that can fit into any sort of techno set these days, but which, at least to my ears, owes a lot to this post-dubstep era (or maybe even exists because of it).\n\nI wouldn't be thinking about all of this this if it wasn't for D1's music, which I came across again through Youtube. But it wasn't the darkside, Youngsta-approved stuff that held my attention. It was his lighter side, like the sunny 2-stepper “Atmosphere”, the old school house chords and rave stabs of “Jus Business”, and the bubbly and emotive rollage of “Joy”. Music that he'd been making during this post-dubstep era, but which was never referenced within that framework; upon listening to it, could've found its place within it.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nPart of the classic dubstep vanguard, D1 was sneaking into the FWD>> night at the age of 15, soaking up the dark and dubby garage mutations of Horsepower Productions, Zed Bias, El-B and whatever DJ Hatcha would play (mostly the earliest Skream and Benga dubplates). He would go to the now-closed Black Market Records shop where he became friends with one of its employees, Daniel Lockhart aka DJ Youngsta, who encouraged him to get into production. In 2004, at the age of 16, he signed with the pioneering label Tempa; and his “Crack Bong” would be released on an EP alongside tracks from big names Kode9, Geeneus and El-B and new faces Loefah and Mala. He would form an alliance with Youngsta, who gave him pointers into how to perfect his sound according to his own vision (which culminated with the _Dubstep Allstars 2_ mix cd) and who presumably had first dibs on D1's fresh unreleased dubplates. His style became an important contribution to the formation of the South London sound (even though he came from West London): the dark and dubby,  Croydon dreadstep which would submerge FWD>> attendees in overwhelming subbass. One of his own tracks would serve as the opener to the Dubstep Warz one-off special broadcasted on BBC Radio 1 in 2006.\n\nD1 grew up in a musical family and learned to play the piano and the saxophone at a very young age. Maybe because he approached his beat-making in terms of chord progressions and harmony, and because he had a wide range musical interests, he grew weary of the classic sound that he had helped shape and personally felt like he'd become creatively stagnant. He sought to take a more “melodic” approach to the “140 bpm sound”. By 2008, his creative partnership with Tempa and Youngsta came to an end and he joined Caspa's Dub Police/Sub Soldiers crew, where he experimented with a dubstep sound inspired by Diplo, Redlight, old school rave, and house (à la Herve and Switch from the Dubsided label).\n\nHis joining of the Dub Police label was, stylistically at least, a weird one. Caspa (also a FWD>> attendee since the early days) had already begun his transition towards the brostep sound with his label, while D1, who occasionally made the odd wobble tune here and there, mostly dabbled into this “brighter” style. Brostep was aggressive and very macho with a I-don't-give-a-fuck ethos. D1's music was heavy, yes, but it was more “groove-based”, rhythmically intricate, putting his percussive flair to great use without any sign of macho-ism or aggression; instead it could have melancholic and emotive melodic sensibilities. Sometimes his synths have a weightless, ethereal yet euphoric quality to them, like if they had been taken from an ambient house, idm or, even, a new age record. According to D1 himself,  the opening track of this mix, “Identify”, “felt like trying to make trance”. It was a hint of things to come from the West London producer.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nThis showcase mix was made to put D1's melodic “140 sound” side by side with “post-dubstep” music to shape a diverse-yet-uniform vibe. His tracks in this mix come from his late-Tempa output, his Dub Police material, and from a batch of freebies released through Hedmuk's blog (neatly put in playlists by a kind Youtube user). I tried to get a wide range of artists and labels that would fit in this mix, without breaking the flow too much. We've got Martyn, Brackles, TRG (Cosmin' TRG, that is) and Peverelist doing neo-Detroit-via-UK vibes on the 3024 label, Appleblim's Apple Pips label, Ben UFO's and Pearson Sound's Hessle Audio, and Pev's own Punch Drunk. Also from Punch Drunk is Hyetal's and Shortstuff's (aka Mickey Pearce) sugary-sweet take on the purple sound. Addison Groove (aka Headhunter) comes through with the drum-machine Juke sound on Swamp 81. Untold's weird little number, “Gonna Work Out Fine” from his own label Hemlock, is an early sign of the extreme-percussion-ponctuation that will show up in underground club/uk bass/deconstructed circles throughout the 2010s (even Scratcha's recent Soul Destroyer remix of Basstone). That's preceded by a Night Slugs jam in Bok Bok and Cubic Zirconia's “Reclash (Dub)”. And, finally, I included a track from one of his Dub Police label-mates, Emalkay: the overlooked gem and b-side to “When I Look At You”, “A.G.S. (Angie Got Stoned)”.\n\nBut this mix is also, for me, a chance to reminisce about those times. You see, dubstep was my first love in electronic music, and I first got into it, earnestly, when all this nonsense was going on. A few months ago, when I first heard D1's “3d Sense” and “Mk 66” from the freebies pack, then discovered everything else from this mix (except “Identify”, I was already well familiar with that one), I was immediately transported back to 8-10 years ago when I discovered all these dubstep/post-dubstep sounds,  when I would listen to it on Youtube and Grooveshark until 3-4 am, downloading Rinse podcasts (the former pirate radio station had just got its licnse) and putting them on my non-Apple mp3 player, and listening to them on the bus with shit headphones on my way to the Cégep (and on the trip home, of course). I still hadn't gone to a club yet, so that was how I experienced this music back then. And I loved every second. Some of it holds up, some of it doesn't. Maybe some of it (post-dubstep) was contrived, but it was certainly a breath of fresh air after spending about 2 years listening to jazzy hip hop instrumentals from Japanese producers and US beat-tapes (Oh No, Madlib, J Dilla) and not being familiar at the time with jungle, dnb, techno, idm, garage, house.\n\nSo I hope you enjoy. Some of these D1 tracks (“Joy”, “Identify”, “Forever remix”) are some of my favourites from the dubstep diaspora in general\n. And while I do hope some of you will feel some nostalgia for this music, for the love of God, I also hope no one starts \"bringing it back\". There's enough revivalism as is.\n\n_\\*\\*Check bottom of article for additional links_\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/621429525&color=%23056ba6&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<Tracklist tracksStr={[{\"startTime\":\"00:00\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Identify (Tempa)\"},{\"startTime\":\"4:08\",\"artist\":\"Martyn\",\"trackName\":\"Twenty Four (3024)\"},{\"startTime\":\"6:10\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"3rd Sense (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"8:55\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Organ Grinder (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"12:07\",\"artist\":\"Bok Bok & Cubic Zirconia\",\"trackName\":\"Reclash (Dub) (Night Slugs)\"},{\"startTime\":\"14:24\",\"artist\":\"Untold \",\"trackName\":\"Gonna Work Out Fine (Hemlock)\"},{\"startTime\":\"16:00\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Cave (Tempa)\"},{\"startTime\":\"18:44\",\"artist\":\"TRG\",\"trackName\":\"Broken Heart (Hessle Audio)\"},{\"startTime\":\"20:55\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Joy (Tempa)\"},{\"startTime\":\"25:08\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"I'm Lovin' (Dub Police)\"},{\"startTime\":\"26:58\",\"artist\":\"Brackles\",\"trackName\":\"Lizards (Apple Pips)\"},{\"startTime\":\"28:50\",\"artist\":\"Peverelist\",\"trackName\":\"Not Yet Further Than (Punch Drunk)\"},{\"startTime\":\"31:30\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Jus Business (Dub Police)\"},{\"startTime\":\"33:30\",\"artist\":\"Emalkay\",\"trackName\":\"A.G.S (Angie Got Stoned) (Dub Police)\"},{\"startTime\":\"36:30\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"Mk 66 (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"38:40\",\"artist\":\"D1\",\"trackName\":\"All in Da Swing (hedmuk downloads)\"},{\"startTime\":\"40:40\",\"artist\":\"Addison Groove\",\"trackName\":\"Dumbshit (Swamp 81)\"},{\"startTime\":\"42:32\",\"artist\":\"Hyetal & Shortstuff\",\"trackName\":\"Ice Cream (Punch Drunk)\"},{\"startTime\":\"45:30\",\"artist\":\"Conquest\",\"trackName\":\"Forever (D1 Remix) (Dub Police)\"}]} />\n\n//\n\n_Both freebies packs are available on Youtube playlists.

(+ March mixes and sets)","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/titleimage-1-.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"A short reflection on the tendencies of modern underground electronic club music with my recommended mixes and sets from March in the spirit of that reflection.","body":"One of the things that has defined underground club music during this decade (which is now coming to a close) is the almost complete deconstruction of its chronology.  I've somewhat already touched upon this on some [past](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_the-past-is-now-the-future-was-then) [entries](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181126_hardcore-will-never-die); but to briefly reiterate: the “new” (the “innovative”, the \"fresh\", the “future”, the “unknown”) is no longer the sole object of fixation; the “good” simply suffices. \n\nThe instant accessibility of 40 years of electronic club music has been a reality for the past 10+ years. DJs, producers and listeners (and not just the geekiest of them anymore) are now more and more aware of its history, digging deeper and deeper to see what can be discovered and rediscovered, introduced and brought back to life, imitated and reinterpreted, etc.\n\nEverything and anything can be new now. Young DJs making a living out of playing old boogie records isn't weird. In fact, you can probably book one for your house or techno night, and not many people will bat an eye. I don't know how many times I've heard a track on a set, thinking it was new, only to find out later that it had come out 25 years ago – and vice versa.\n\nThis thought came into my back during the mesmerizing first hour of Josey Rebelle's set in Toronto back in February – a completely obvious fact as to be almost laughably : for all the stylistic flourishes that club music has gone through in the past three decades or so, the backbone has always been, well, bass and drums (not to say “drum and bass”). That is what ties it all together.  Josey Rebelle seems to take that to heart; her set in Toronto consisted of stripped-back beats from these last three decades, mixing a breakbeat techno track into a minimalist UK funky track into an old school Chicago drum machine, hand-clap jam into a weighty, modern UK techno track (à la Kaizen) - all of it ready to make the bass bins burst into flames. It was her careful selection that made it seem like,  despite all of these tracks' different origins, in the end, it's all the same thing, and it all congealed into a cohesive-yet-varied sound.\n\nThose are the kind of DJs that are my favourites: the ones that have a particular vision, the ones who aim to achieve a particular sound or vibe, while taking music from different places (and now, from different eras). It's like how Ben UFO used to do back in the early part of this decade, mixing techno with carefully selected grime and dubstep tracks, underlining the similarities these seemingly disparate genres might have. Much more interesting than the DJs that just go through the Drumcode and Planet Rhythm catalogs, or the genre-hopping DJs with a severe lack of focus and no vision.\n\nInadvertently, this ended up being the underlying theme for most of my mixes selection for the month of March: _It's All About Bass and Drums Still, Isn't?_ I've always leaned towards the more stripped-back, “groove-based” side of club music, whether in house, dubstep or dnb, and these mixes really reflect that. They mostly consist of new “new” music (which I actively look for nowadays), mostly drawing from fresher styles of underground club music. As such, none of them really adhere to a genre, but each strive to reach a vibe showing how they interpret \"deep\", \"rude\", \"heavy\" electronic club music somewhat rooted in (or influenced by) UK sound system culture (hardcore, dnb, jungle, dubstep, etc).\n\n**Anna Morgan**'s ravey mix of hard drum, subby UK techno, new wave breakbeat techno (including a great remix of Mr Vegas' “Head High”) and weird 4x4 techno tracks from the likes of Object Blue and Quest?onmarc makes for a thrilling listen. **Shampain **keeps it ravey as well with his set on Noods Radio which ranges from leftfield, bright electro and 4x4 weighty stompers (including an awesome hard dance remix of Destiny Child's “Lose My Breath”). **Deena Abdelwahed **also leans close to UK techno sounds, but hones into a more “tribal”/oriental vibe, if you will. **Chants **takes that tribal vibe further into global bass and hard drum territory that would sure make the Nervous Horizon members grin like idiots. **Henry Greenleaf** does his own take on UK techno, influenced by old school dubstep's dubby vibes and Swamp 81's trippier subbass excursions. Toronto's **Ciel **goes into stripped-back and bassy (and sometimes heavy) underground house, techno and electro vibes for the city's new ISO Radio, including fresh tracks from great new producers like Nite Fleit, Klein Zage, Lauren Flax (her “Work Dat” has really been making the rounds, eh?) and herself. Following his big Keep Hush set, Manchester's **Strategy **has been on people's radars and he joins Chunky for his birthday special on NTS Radio to offer one hour of his own new, unreleased material: a concoction of funky, deep tech, old XXXY-like tracks, electro and Swamp 81-approved beats. Finally, **DJ Booga** from Germany offers a set of the modern, deeper ends of everything dnb (two-steppers, halftime, juke-inspired, dark atmopheric, etc, etc).\n\nThere you have it: eight great mixes and sets from March of new, groove-based ravey goodness. And a **DJ Katapila** set of Afrobeats and Afropop to top it off. His releases on Awesome Tapes From Africa are kind of shit to be honest, but he's a fine selector.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Anna Morgan - Kaizen Show 28th March 2019 (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fthe-kaizen-show-w-madam-x-28th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"LEFT\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\n**\\*\\*HER SET STARTS AT AROUND 01:02:00\\*\\***\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Shampain- 12th March 2019 (Noods Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fshampain-12th-march-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Deena Abdelwahed - 14th March 2019 (Rinse FM)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/590333844&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Chants - JEROME Mixfile #420\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/588622329&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf - Fresh Kicks97\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/590537442&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ciel - 8th March 2019 (ISO Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FISORadio%2Finternational-womens-day-ciel-8th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Strategy - Chunky's Birthday Special 17th March (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fchunky-17th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n\\*\\*HIS SET STARTS AT AROUND 00:30:40\\*\\*\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Booga - DLPC #033\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/589365975&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Katapila - 12th March 2019 (Noods Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fdj-katapila-12th-march-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />","name":"20190417_its-all-about-bass-and-drums-still-isnt","urlPath":"/article/20190417_its-all-about-bass-and-drums-still-isnt"},{"publicationDate":"Mar 19, 2019","title":"Future Bits and Pieces","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/cs702073-01a-big.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"I've go advanced promo copies now, so I go through some upcoming stuff and some unreleased material to see what's on the horizon","body":"Well, I've become my own worst enemy; I'm officially writing reviews for a magazine. In my case case, I've joined the writing team for the \"Frequencies\" section (or \"dance & electronic\" as they otherwise put it) of Exclaim. It's not so much for my prowess in writing (I think), as it is for the fact that I \"look like I know my stuff\". They must be unaware that there are thousands of people on discogs and soundcloud with an infinite amount of knowledge about electronic music, much more than I could hope to achieve in the next, say, 10 years? I take it that my penchant for writing about music already on this blog made me an appealing addition to their team, which was apparently lacking in writers.\n\nWhich means that, now, I have to write about one review a week, for releases of my choosing, without crossing the 300 word limit by too much. So for those roughly 300 words a week, I'm given what is probably the greatest perk in being a reviewer: getting my hands on future records (digital format, of course), sometimes well before their release dates (months, for example).\n\nThat was the case for the inaugural V/A EP of a new Toronto-based label, Parallel Minds, for which I had to write a review at the beginning of February. The EP consists of 4 tracks from Toronto producers: the relatively unknowns Yohei S., Radiant Aura Faculty (aka Raf Reza) and Daniel 58, lead by Ciel, whom you might know from her release Shanti Celeste's Peach Discs label. Her \"Hind Sight is 360\" here, an energetic and dreamy deep house track with 90s Moby vibes, is tied with this year's remix of Ilana Bryne's \"Mmm Mmm Mmm\" for being by far her best work yet. The rest is really solid as well. Listen to samples [here](https://soundcloud.com/weareparallelminds/parallel-minds-vol-1-various-artists?in=cl_lit/sets/parallel-minds-vol-1). It comes out on April 12th (iirc) so my review should be up around that time. \n\nComing out this Friday, which I also reviewed, is Dead Man Chest's new record on Sneaker Social Club. He calls up his \"new school\" old school junglist peeps Sonic, Response and Coco Bryce for some collabs. The Response one is the best of the bunch, unsurprisingly. Last year, Response & Pilkin showed us with their \"Plastic Face / Tangled Up\" that there's still some legs to 150bpm ethereal four-on-the-floor jungle beats à la Dreamscape circa 93. DMC and Response revisit that idea with their \"We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes\".  DMC also explores that sound with the Sonic [collab](https://soundcloud.com/sneakersocialclub/dead-mans-chest-x-sonic-pum-flex-ra-tracks), though to slightly lesser effect. \n\nSpeaking of Sonic, go peep his new LP, _110174, on _Western Lore._ _It beautifully bridges the gap between old school sounds and new school d'n'b (i.e. more \"techy\", sometimes \"ghetto bass-influenced\"). There's some great 150-160bpm 4x4 d'n'b in there, as well as straight up revivalism stuff like \"Empty Bar\". Bristol's Western Lore continues its hot streak.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\" Sonic - Empty Bar (Western Lore)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/570099861&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd speaking about four-on-the-floor d'n'b, how 'bout we get on with the promos I've received for upcoming releases that I feel are worth mentioning. How about Fracture's _Big Up the Ladies EP_? Its titular track also does some old school/new school gap-bridging (...), starting with old school rave chords. and then dropping into a 4x4 beat with ragga vocal samples and breaks while having that \"techy\", \"twitchy\" modern feel. The rest of the release follows suit in this new \"turbo\" sound, as he's dubbed it (not joking). Although he did it much better with last year's \"Turbo Toms\", this is still solid. It comes out the 12th of April on the forward thinking club-focused Astrophonica. \"Big Up the Ladies\" has been made available.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Fracture - Big Up The Ladies\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=245406130/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://fracture.bandcamp.com/album/big-up-the-ladies\">Big Up The Ladies by Fracture</a></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Fracture - Turbo Toms\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1410055085/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2187643463/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://exitrecordsuk.bandcamp.com/album/exit081-fracture-soundboy-get-nervous-ep\">EXIT081 - Fracture - &#39;Soundboy Get Nervous&#39; EP by Fracture</a></iframe>} />\n\nSo it seems like four-on-the-flour jungle/d'n'b might be a thing now, or in the near-future? If it is, I'm expecting it to get swallowed up by the juke/trap/ghetto-inspired d'n'b DJs like Sinistarr, Valerie Molano and A.Fruits. Should be good. \n\nOn a more laid-back vibe is another label inauguration - Berlin's Sensible Seelen - with a collab by the label's founders DJ Kusse and Khshathra. DJ Kusse is actually one half of Hi & Saberhagen, whose _Light on Leaves_ from last year was a great idm-ish minimal deep house treat. On _Sensible Seelen Vol. 1, _the Berliners go for a late-night, headphones-listening kind of vibe with contemplative, melancholic house. The opener \"Into Your Soul\" sets the tone as a jazzy downtempo number. I'm not usually into this kind of stuff, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Samo DJ and Karima F round it out with a remixes, the latter one offering something that resembles 90s' Smith & Mighty. [Snippets ](https://soundcloud.com/sensibleseelen/sensible-seelen-vol-1-snippets)are available. It comes out on the 29th of this month.\n\nFor some \"dancefloor fodder\", keep an eye out for Ejeca's new release on Unknown to the Unknown for the label's Dance Trax series, where they place their more direct and high-energy stuff. The opener \"Gilboa\" sounds like something that Peverelist would come up with if he was forced to do some 4x4 big room techno, mainly due to the main melody; or, to be more precise, like a Peverelist and Roberto collab. I could do without the Truncate remix, but it's not offensive. Snippets are available on [Juno](https://www.juno.co.uk/products/ejeca-dance-trax-vol-18/718899-01/). It comes out sometime in April according to the promo.\n\nLastly, Gary Gritness's upcoming LP, _The Legend of Cherenkov Blue, _on the Hypercolour label is about to be my first reviewed 9/10. Gritness has made it his mission to keep that ol' school funk sound alive in his electro style. The album continues in that vein, ranging from Dam Funk-esque jams to Underground Resistance-styled techno at its \"frenziest\", to Drexciya-inspired electro - all with the melodic sensibilities of retro video games. According to the promo, there's a narrative thread to the whole album, but apart for some vocal samples, it's all instrumental, so I don't care much for it. All I know is that it's a ~~g~~ood fucking time, much better than what the mighty Morphology have been cooking up these last couple of years. The album comes out on the 19th of April, so my review will be up around that time.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Gary Gritness - The Legend of Cherenkov Blue (SNIPPETS)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/582692388&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n## The fresh smell of acetate\n\nOn to the unreleased tracks that I've just started to collect on my Youtube profile. I've done so just to have an easy way to listen to these great tracks without having to load up the mixes. Also, because I have mad respect for people that do it for, say, dubstep tracks, without whom I would never have known about certain music (all the early DMZ, Skream and Benga unreleased tracks that are amazing).\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Koehler - Winged\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0z9uWqO6Ieg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nI heard this on Koehler's [Groove podcast mix](https://groove.de/2019/01/11/koehler-groove-podcast-193/) from January and it blew me away instantly. Koehler is a producer whom I've always felt could make better music, even if I enjoy his stuff on Skudge and Berceuse Heroique, and even if _Oblivious Pool_ was one of my favourite releases from 2017. Well, with \"Winged\", he's answered my wish. To me, \"Winged\" is the perfect embodiment of what \"_keeping the spirit of hardcore and rave_\" means. Without resorting to retroism or revivalism (or nostalgia), he's able to conjure up the euphoria of past rave music, better than the jungle revivalists, better than the hardcore revivalists and better than the house producers currently using amen breaks (again...).  Will this get a release? Who knows...\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Impey - Conquest Mode\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4sU1LJvl4s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nI love Peverelist's work, and I love the music that he's pushed on his labels, but I can't help but feel like he's been in a creative rut for about a year,  despite the consistent quality of his mixes and output from both him and his \"crew\". On his and Kowton's Livity Sound show of February on NTS Radio, they freshened things up a bit by dropping the tempo to about 110bpm for the majority of the episode, leading them to drop this, Impey's \"Conquest Mode\".  Something different for both the grime producer and techno/bass DJs . Am I crazy, or is this almost on some hyphy tip? Leftfield dubby hyphy, maybe? Anyways, I like this direction, and I've also been enjoying the recent bass music of 90-110 bpm that's been coming out these last couple of years. Even Loefah has be dabbling in some 100-110bpm stuff. It's like he says to Youngsta on their Heavyweight LDN interview a couple of months ago, \"_I feel like there needs to be something fresh right now. It's time for something fresh_.\" Will the slower tempos lead to further things? We can only wait and see, really.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Cyclist – Inhale Exhale (Bruce’s Deep Breath Mix) (dubplate)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zs3lGFakW_Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nHow about this remix from UK's Bruce? To be honest, I haven't been following him for about a year and a half ever since his whole \"contemplative, emotional dance music\" phase (which means that, yes, I still haven't listened to his album from last year). But this track, taken from Hodge's Groove Podcast mix from February, makes me regret not doing so. I like the sparsity of the production, the skeletal, metallic hi-hats, the heavy kicks that punctuate the first beats and a great use of electric guitar samples. It's atmospheric, in a way, but it has some rhythmic edge to it, you know?\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"AceMo & J.

AceMo has been making some noise this past year, following his release on the Michigan label Vanity Press and his _All My Life_ collection of tracks from this year. This still-untitled J. Albert collab is the best stuff I've heard from him yet. Beautiful sparse-but-effective synthwork here. A great, steady groove with melodic, melancholic atmospherics.

It's now time to have a quick look-back at the mixes I enjoyed and that have come out during the month of February. Yes, I know that we're into the second week of March and that I'm even later than I was last month.  But last month ended before I had realized that it had ended, and there were still some mixes that I wanted to listen before moving on to this month's output. Those couple of extra listens weren't particularly fruitful, though, so the list ended up being short, having one less entry than the last one. Nevertheless, each of these are great listens. Let's go.\n\n_\\* Oh shit, I've just realized that the Soca mix is from last week... It probably would've ended up on the March list anyways. The important thing is that it's good. That is all._\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Heatwave - Soca Season on Rinse FM\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Ftheheatwave%2Fsoca-season-on-rinse-fm%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nIf, like me, you've heard about this so-called \"Soca Season\" and asked yourself: \"When, exacly, is it Soca Season?\". And then you went on to google it and found no clear answers whatsoever (it seems like soca afficionados on forums aren't ever sure themselves...), well, now we know, at least for this year. It's just passed. \n\nGabriel Heatwave (whose King Tubby tribute mix made an appearance in last month's list) brings us the hits from this year's season of carnivals. There are some absolute gems here, like Patrice Robert's \"Like it Hot\", Nessa Preppy's \"Issa Snack\", and \"Party Start\" courtesy of Swappi & Ultimate Rejects. 1 hour of bright, upbeat goodness from the UK dancehall selector.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Szare - 2nd February 2019 (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fszare-2nd-february-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nI promised the sunshine, now here's the gloom, though it is no less frenetic. Szare, whose oriental-flavoured riddim \"Miner\" is one my favourite tracks from these last few months, plunges into colder, darker vibes, going from the minimal and industrial techno of Clouds, to twitchy idm-ish tribal affairs, to the deep dystopian roller of Kenya's Slikback. Szare's mix straddles the line between chin-stroking home-listening and neurotic danceabilty, staying engaging the whole way through. And it gets extra points for making me realize that I'm still not completely bored with the industrial and ebm sounds that you currently can't escape from in underground electronic music.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Trends B2B Boylan B2B DOK With Novelist & Manga St Hilare - PyroRadio - (04/02/2019)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEjDra2RY3A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nGrime hasn't been the flavour of the day for quite some time now, being recently usurped by the still-rising UK hip hop/UK drill/afroswing scene, but this 30-minute set gets everything right. It's got two of the best new age dj/producers (Trends and Boylan) behind the decks, and two of the best new age MCs on the mics. It's short  and sweet, the DJs keep the energy levels up, and they keep things surprising and exciting for the MCs, juggling between new age trappy sounds and bouncy, jump-up riddims that don't care if they sound ridiculous. Also, for my money, grime is at its best on live sets (as opposed to albums).\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Flora Yin-Wong | Keep Hush Live: Nice One Takeover\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U7jD_wZzxko\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nYou'll probably recognize the Keep Hush youtube channel, who seem to have taken it upon themselves to replicate the atmosphere of old Boiler Room circa 2010, pushing out underground UK sounds (without getting the deluge of downvotes from the house and techno purists that are now Boiler Room's main audience) . Although they don't promote new genres enough for my liking, their recordings have stayed consistent in quality.\n\nLast month, they invited over Flora Yin-Wong, who I know nothing about, to be honest. Admittedly, the first couple of minutes here are kind of dead lol. But boy does it pick up, with Nazar's ice-cold and heavy \"Airstrike\" beautifully setting the mood for the 100bpm (ish) section. The dancehall and reggaeton tempo has become a fixation for more and more underground djs and producers these last couple of years, and Flora shows us why. She ends her short set in style with some UK Funky/Hard Drum vibes.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kyam - Artist Mix #011 for Ronin Ordinance\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/569059542&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nSpeeding things up with some good ol' DnB. There isn't much info about Kyam. All I know is that he's released one of my favourite tracks of this year, so far, in his \"[VHX](https://soundcloud.com/kyamofficial/vhx)\", and that he seems to be good selector. Sure, he isn't re-inventing anything here. But in just under 1 hour, Kyam goes through various styles of deep, heavy Dnb and Jungle (as a commentator has already remarked), even adding in a hardcore techno/gabber track like if it was a Helkter Skelter set, and keeping things fresh the whole way through.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Yilan - Newtype Rhythms #72 - Special Guest Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/575029449&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n_His mix starts at around 44:30_\n\nA mix to promote his new release _Diaspora. _Yilan is a producer/dj from the UK who's focused on the deep techno sounds from over there, similar to the likes of Yak, Henry Greenleaf, Madam X... Here he's able to achieve a great balance between atmospheric vibes and heavy ones, having recourse to more than a handful of unreleased tracks, which includes Yak's tribal material in his \"Kaepora\", and a dangerous collab between Manga (yes, that same grime MC) and Mikes Drones & Padawan Sound.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"East Man - Stush!\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/575866695&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nWe started this list with some modern Soca, now let's end it with some old school 90s ragga/dancehall. For those that don't know, East Man is Anthony J Hart's (aka Basic Rhythm) alias under which he fleshes out a [revamped take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Dy8RQSjcs) on those old school, gritty, skeletal white label grime beats with his own \"cleaner\" production. There's no info about his \"Stush!\" mix, but to my ears, this seems to be a collection of proto-grime ragga tunes. You can hear it in the sparse arrangements with syncopated heavy drums and cold synths. Even some early grime MCs like God's Gift and MC Viper had a heavy ragga-influenced delivery style. Also, we can hear how these type of tunes _still _inform a lot of current underground UK bass music (like, say, Yilan's for example). Immortal sounds.","name":"20190312_carnival-sunshine-to-dystopian-pulses-february-mixes","urlPath":"/article/20190312_carnival-sunshine-to-dystopian-pulses-february-mixes"},{"publicationDate":"Mar 10, 2019","title":"Deep Skanking - Dubstep's Digitized Roots","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/title-image-compressed.png","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"I briefly talk about dubstep's sonic origins and share the playlist in which I collected \"proto-dubstep\" tracks available to stream on Spotify and Google Play. ","body":"O the glory days of Grooveshark. When I started to get into electronic music (around 2010 ) and dove straight into my first genre of choice, dubstep, Grooveshark was all I needed to embark on my deep exploration. You see, I discovered the genre mainly through the site: listening to all the classic stuff from the Digital Mystikz and Loefah; as well as everything from the classic labels such as Tectonic, Hotflush, Tempa, Dub Soldiers, Chestplate, DMZ; and on top of that, the influential mixes like the first two _Dubstep Allstars_ volumes, Skream's entry for _Watch the Ride_, and Caspa & Rusko's _Fabriclive 37_. It was all there.\n\nAfter it inevitably closed down, we've had to contend ourselves with a decentralized experience of listening to music: from Youtube, to Bandcamp, and Soundcloud; then on Spotify, Google Music, Deezer, or Tidal; and finally maybe on Beatport. And if all these options fail you in finding what you're looking for, well, you have to take up crime and look into unofficial venues. It truly leaves a sour taste in the mouth because Grooveshark proved that the technology and means are there to centralize music. Oh well.\n\nDiscovering electronic club music from before 2008 (ish) can sometimes be quite a hassle and lead to frustration. When it comes to club music (house, techno, dnb, jungle, garage, trance, etc, etc), most of it from before that year came out as singles or EPs on vinyl. If we aren't willing to shell out the money (prices go up fast with shipping fees), we have to hope that someone has uploaded a rip on Youtube or that a label has released digital versions of their backlog. Thankfully, both music collectors and labels have been hard at work this past decade,  so the gaps are receding.\n\nAll this rambling leads me to the point: I've recently made a playlist, available on both [Spotify ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AIeV1cAXEgG06uclrjJ3V)and [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXylEBAUu0Rl4TVzG75VzPKEWCCewMV4E2SiE-NdwvHe5L4RLqRus9QLgZRQiqjU01RbXoHED4zZPHLbwCeRQzLmGLo6MOw%3D%3D), that shares the same name as this article, _Deep Skanking: Dubstep's Digitized Roots_. By  “dubstep's roots” here, I don't mean the classic 2004-7ish material that I listed up top, but the pre-2004 music that shaped what eventually became what we now recognize as “dubstep”; back when the scene was centered around the “FWD>>” (pronounced “forward”) club night in London. \n\nMy goal for this playlist was to be able to listen as much of as I could in one place. This idea sprang to my mind when I was  skimming through Beatport and noticed that DJ Zinc had released his seminal proto-grime/proto-dubstep track “138 Trek” (from 2000) in digital format on streaming platforms, as well as all the stuff from his Bingo Beats label. And shortly after, I realized that Locked On, an influential proto-dubstep label coming from a UK Garage standpoint, had also made its releases from the early 2000s available for streaming.\n\nDubstep didn't come out of a vacuum. In my [Dubstep Allstars retrospective](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181124_a-look-back-dubstep-allstars-a-movement-takes-shape), I wrote about the two DJs, Hatcha and Youngsta, who were the most influential in shaping the South London sound of “140bpm bass music”, that we know as old school dubstep. However, from 2000 (ish) to 2004, there was a whole scene around them (however small it was in the grand scheme of things). The established grand narrative of dubstep would have you think that, before 2004,  everyone was playing the same tracks from the same people (namely El-B, Horsepower Productions, Zed Bias, Skream, Benga, Artwork). But that is an incomplete story of dubstep's origins. (the complete story is beyond the scope of this entry and my knowledge)\n\nNow, I wasn't there, so both my knowledge and my selection for this playlist are strictly based on old sets, nostalgia sets, interviews and blog posts. The important thing to understand is that, like the beginning of every genre, there wasn't yet a clear-cut, defined “genre”. FWD's mission wasn't to invent a new one either; it was simply to promote underground club music. In this case, due to the era in which it started, that largely meant underground 2-step/UK Garage. But there we only so many garage tracks that fit the criteria. So DJs had to get creative with their selection, look outside of the genre to find tracks that would fit with the club night's overall vibe. Look into future jazz, broken beat techno, breaks, and maybe some electro; and even 8-bar and eski beat – both being early iterations of grime. And the sound progressed, incubating within this small scene, with all of those sounds being part of its DNA. As it went along, there was a focus on making it \"darker\".\n\nAt the end of the day, it was about playing “deep” sounds. Informed by “garridge music”, but not strictly “garridge”. Deep sounds, as opposed to the poppier vibe that the genre had been shifting into, like Wookie and Selena's syrupy strings in “[Give it Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiO53Cvjro)”, MJ Cole's soul-tinged “[Sincere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02KRAshCG0w)” and So Solid Crew's bling-bling style with their “[Sentimental Things (Oh No)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guJ0NyQVs9I)”.\n\nCompare those with Marcus Intalex and ST Files's “Taking Over Me”, which initiates the playlist. It's a house track, through and through, but its rollings breaks and atmospheric synths were a great fit for FWD, something that, for example, Blackdown would use to pad out his sets (as he explains in this great[ blog post](http://blackdownsoundboy.blogspot.com/2018/12/roots-of-reflections.html)).\n\nThe obvious players are almost all here (again, those whose music is available to stream): El-B, Zed Bias (Phturistix, Maddslinky, E.S. Dubs) and Horsepower Productions. But let's not forget the ultra-minimalist and raw 8-bar sounds of Big$hot, Youngstar and Corporation of London, whose beats were made for MCs but that could blend well with Horsepower Productions' “tribal garage” (“Fat Larry's Skank”) or Zed Bias' heavy fusion of future jazz and garage (e.g. “Reject”, \"551 Blues\"). Let's also not forget Ms Dynamite's bashment/garage collabs with Oris Jay/Darwqwan (“Test Dis”), Menta (“Ramp”) or Sticky (Booo!) that could go well beside Nubian Mindz' heavy broken beat techno, or beside DJ Zinc/Jammin's brand of “breakstep” that he pushed with his Bingo Beats label. Etc, Etc,.\n\n There are some glaring holes though. Tempa hasn't made most of its pre-2005 backlog available for streaming, and neither have its affiliated labels (ShelfLife, Soulja and Road). Big Apple Records, another influential South London label, which promoted Skream, Benga, Loefah, and the Digital Mystikz, has closed shop a while ago and their releases have remained vinyl-only. Also missing for streaming are the releases from Texture Records, which focused on the “breaks” side of the “140 scene”, and became more aggro as it went on. Finally, all of the early white-label grime releases are obviously missing, notably the material from Jon E Cash and DJ Wonder whose approach with skeletal production and sub-bass overload very much informed what became \"dubstep\".\n\nNevertheless, the 60+ tracks I've compiled (taken from various re-releases and compilations) should give you a pretty good idea of where the genre came from, _sonically_. One last thing I'd like to point out regarding the playlist: the last six tracks are “proper dubstep”, ranging from 2004 to 2008. These were selected to include the five South London producers who were the favourites of Hatcha and Younga (D1, Loefah, Mala, Benga, Coki) and also to have different styles, which is why I chose Distance's “Tropical Rub”, whose aggro vibe is a precursor to what would become the “brostep” sound (that “filthy”, aggressive, wub wub, “drop it like a B0:55” style that became popular around the world in the early 2010s). We have Loefah's dread-filled beats, Mala's meditative dub-rasta deepness, Benga and Coki's preference for more bouncy, ravey riddims, and, lastly, Skream's “Hedd Banger” which showcases the classic, dark and deep halfstep style. The 62 preceding tracks should let you be able to further contextualize them musically.\n\n_I've assembled the tracks in chronological order, then organized them in alphabetical order (according to artist names) within their year of release. This was done to make it much simpler for me, so there's no “flow” that I tried to establish. At 6+ hours, this isn't really a playlist that you'd listen in one sitting. Whether you want to skim through it or listen in multiple sessions, is up to each listener, obviously._\n\n[SPOTIFY PLAYLIST LINK](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AIeV1cAXEgG06uclrjJ3V)\n\n[GOOGLE PLAYLIST LINK](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXylEBAUu0Rl4TVzG75VzPKEWCCewMV4E2SiE-NdwvHe5L4RLqRus9QLgZRQiqjU01RbXoHED4zZPHLbwCeRQzLmGLo6MOw%3D%3D)\n\nTracklist:\n\n2000\n\nMarcus Intalex + S.T.

Actually, why shouldn't there be? I don't know how many hours of DJs sets and mixes are uploaded every week (or day), but at this point, it has to be a huge fucking number. So I thought I'd make a list of the things I've enjoyed, to give people a glimpse into what is worth their time (I hope).\n\nI don't know if I'm going to make a regular series out of this. Like a lot of things on this blog, I partly do it for myself. In this case, I'd though I'd do a quick look-back at the month of January, in terms of the mixes that have left an immediate impression. If I'm to make a year-end list like I did with 2018, then this initiative also makes the final choosing process a lot easier. Yet, as a digger, I'll probably stumble upon something that I somehow missed and that, yes, probably should have been here. Doesn't matter. This is what I've enjoyed the most from January, as of now. It's a pretty solid list.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Truancy Volume 233: Peverelist\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/564031296&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nI've already expressed my [great appreciation](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181104_peverelist-s-bass-music-jungle-re-contextualized) for Peverelist's work, so I don't think I'll indulge into praising the man once more. What I will say is that if, like myself, you've never had to opportunity to catch him live (as he rarely ventures out of the UK and Europe), then he's offered a great sneak peak into what his “club-oriented” sets sound like. If you've been tuning into his monthly Livity Sound show on NTS Radio, and if you've listened to the mixes he's released online for the last decade, then you' know that he likes to keeps things “dubby”, “chilled-out”, only intensifying the energy momentarily. This mix starts out that way but quickly shifts into a skanking, percussive, bassy affair, sometimes hinging close to the Hard Drum vibe. A real treat from the legendary Bristol DJ, producer and label head.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Strategy (100% Strategy productions) DJ set | Keep Hush Manchester: Strategy presents\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lsmy8UD-i1U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nI honestly don't know much about Strategy, other than the fact that he's released a DnB record on Exit last year. What drew me to listen to this set was actually Chunky's presence as the host MC. Remember Chunky? Lately, he's been doing his thing with a Manchester-based Hip Hop collective, but back in the early years of this decade, he was the voice of Swamp 81 (when it was one of the coolest and most influential labels in UK underground club music), donning the mic, with Loefah on the decks spinning some spaced-out Electro and Techno. In recent years, due to changing tastes, I feel as if MCs in UK club music have largely been pushed to the margins. Chuncky has also dropped out of the Swamp 81 crew, so it's great to hear his voice again. But I also enjoyed the music itself here. Composed entirely of his own (unreleased) productions, Strategy dips into the 124 bpm territory, venturing into rude House and Funky rhythms, deep UK Techno and halftime beats à la Dubstep.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Heatwave - King Tubby Special - 30th January 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fthe-heatwave-30th-january-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nAlong with David “Ram Jam” Rodigan, Gabriel Heatwave's selection is responsible for my appreciation of Dancehall and all things Reggae. He used to have a weekly show on Rinse FM a few years ago, but lately he's been focused on his Hot Wuk live shows and getting back into production, bringing him to only do monthly shows for both Rinse and NTS. In this month's episode for NTS, he commemorates the work and influence of King Tubby on the week of the 30th anniversary of his murder in Jamaica. Offering one hour of King Tubby-produced songs (mostly Roots and Dub), Gabriel Heatwave briefly explains his influence on the concept of the “remix” and of “producing for MCs” (as opposed to singers). A great listen.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf: 11th January '19 - Noods Radio\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fhenry-greenleaf-11th-january-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nHenry Greenleaf made a appearance in my previous list. As I've stated, he started out as a DnB producer but has made the transition into the UK Techno scene. In this set for Noods Radio, the music is like Greenleaf's own production: weighty, direct, sparse but energetic, and owes to old school Dubstep and Drum n Bass as much as it does to Berlin Techno. What we get here is 2 hours of rolling beats ranging from the dark and minimal to the upbeat and melodic, with quite a handful of dubplates for good measure.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Akito w/ Yetsuby - 11th January 2019 - NTS Radio\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fakito-11th-january-20191%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nThe Sans Absence label boss consistently starts off the new year in a great way with this set for NTS Radio. Also making a second appearance in my lists, he continues with the tribal and funky side of Hard Drum. His guest DJ from South Korea, Yetsuby, takes over for the second half. While her selection doesn't have the strong tribal and percussive leanings of Akito, she hones in on the current UK sound of bass music, packing in a cohesive and diversified set of beats. I didn't know her at all before listening to this show, but I've got to look her stuff up now.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Reclaim Your City - 12 Janvier 2019 - Rinse France\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FRinseFrance%2Freclaim-your-city-12-janvier-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nI came across these guys through some of my favourite producers and DJs who have made guest mixes for this show. Admittedly, I don't really know anything about them, other than the fact that it's a label of the same name which focuses on “the best underground techno from around the globe \". I'm not nearly into the current, “conventional” side of Techno as I was once, but what I love about these guys is that they stay on top of things in the Techno world, and every week on Rinse France they present their own “best of” from what the genre currently has to offer. The last third of this 2-hour show strays into more experimental and leftfield territory, adding a refreshing palette to your typical 4/4 straight Techno. And their sequencing and seamless blends keep things engaging.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Keysound - 24th January 2019 - Rinse FM\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/564396774&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nUK Bass, UK Techno, 130 Sound, whatever it's called -  for the last few years, the main cyber-exporter of this music has been the Keysound show on Rinse FM, with listeners from all over the world (especially the States) locking in to hear what it has to offer that is both fresh and exciting. The show is named after the record label run by Blackdown and Dusk, who became active in the UK underground club scene way back when Dubstep was still in its initial stages and didn't yet have an official name. Blackdown actually runs a [blog](http://blackdownsoundboy.blogspot.com/), which, although currently only semi-active, became an important and influential space in which he could commentate on the nascent scene of Dubstep. Now, as they did back then, they focus on the “new”. At around the end of the first hour, they slip in a few El-B tracks, and Blackdown (I think) remarks: “_His music is why I started to produce music of my own in the first place_”. El-B's work is considered as being a fundamental building block of Dubstep, but this set also demonstrate how the new stuff stills owes a lot to it. El-B's style of UK Garage – infectious grooves, swaggering syncopation, dark atmospherics and bouncy subbass – weaves itself seamlessly into the fresh sounds. \n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kaizen w/ Madam X & AQXDM - 31st January 2019 - NTS  Radio\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fkaizen-31st-january-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nAlong with Keysound's show on Rinse Fm, Madam X' monthly Kaizen show on NTS Radio has become a must-listen for fans wishing to get a taste of the bassy UK Techno that she's been pushing for many years now, as a DJ and label boss. And while it is true that she's been including more conventional 4/4 warehouse techno and jacking House beats into her sets (in part, probably taking away from what made her unique in the global scene), it hasn't taken away from the strength of her selection (she also seems to have the pull to get unreleased exclusive material from UK bass/techno producers), and, mainly, from her innate talent in blending and sequencing the tracks. When she's on, the music becomes more riveting and powerful, sometimes even if you've already heard the tracks before to lesser effect. It's why she's become an underground club hero in the UK scene. She's joined on the second hour by a guest mix from AQXDM – duo composed of  Deapmash, and Toronto-native and Berlin-based Aquarian -  who also delve into the weighty sounds of UK Techno.","name":"20190206_its-all-about-the-echo-chamber-january-mixes","urlPath":"/article/20190206_its-all-about-the-echo-chamber-january-mixes"},{"publicationDate":"Jan 18, 2019","title":"Kraftwerk - Music Endless","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/title-image-1.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"Kraftwerk are considered as the forefathers of current electronic music. We go through some works that contain some of the German group's musical elements.","body":"Confession: about two months ago, I wasn't familiar with Kraftwerk's discography. This is almost heresy, I know.  As someone who writes about electronic music, my unfamiliarity with them is a more than noticeable gap in my knowledge of its history. Kraftwerk's music is widely considered an important building block for all things electronic, from Synthpop, to Techno, to IDM, to Hip hop, to Electro – and beyond. Its DNA weaves itself into all these different styles and genres. And it's on that last point that I would like to expand. \n\n10 years ago, Kraftwerk's music came into the spotlight for a moment, due to the heavily promoted remastered re-releases of their classic albums (_Autobahn_ ('74), _Radio-Activity_ ('75), _Trans-Europe Express_ ('77), _The Man Machine _('78), _Computer World_ ('81)). And although they had piqued my interest, enough to listen to a couple of tracks, for some reason I never bothered to further look into them. Really, I was just too focused on listening to new music. But finally, after nearly a decade, they showed up again as my friend asked that we listen to _Computer World_ as background music when we were hanging out. And right off the bat, what jumped at me was how familiar their music actually sounded. Even more so, when that first listen prompted me to go trough their mentioned classic albums.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/cover-coll-1-.jpg)\n\nSpotting musical influences and lineages can be a tricky thing to do, because influences can be both direct and indirect. Sometimes you can tell, just by listening, that an artist is trying to imitate someone else's music, or trying to mix together those of their contemporaries or predecessors. Sometimes influences become clear only when an artist mentions them. And there are times when an artist's music recalls past works, scenes, or genres _without them actually knowing said works, scenes or genres_.  That's because every music piece is comprised of various bits and pieces of musical elements and ideas that are passed on from people to people, generation to generation. As Simon Reynolds once put it: “_Everything is a remix_.” Kraftwerk is considered as one of the most important groups in contemporary music. Probably more so now, with electronic music becoming extremely prominent (EDM, Hip Hop, RnB, etc, etc). The reach of their influence is almost immeasurable.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Numbers\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YPiCeLwh5o\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nConsider an obvious example of Kraftwerk-influenced music, in Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force's “Planet Rock”, from New York, released a year after _Computer World_. Following the producer's, Arthur Baker, idea for a new song, Bambaataa samples two songs from the German group: _Trans-Europe Express_' titular track, and _Computer World_'s “Numbers”; using the synth work from the former and the beat pattern from the latter. Added on top is some old school rapping,  call and response vocals, and a robotic voice singing “_Rock, rock, the planet rock. Don't stop_”. This results in an early, Electro-styled Hip Hop party anthem.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force - Planet Rock\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9J3lwZjHenA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nThe old school Hip Hop and Kraftwerk connection is a natural one, as the latter have expressed their love for American RnB (and Funk, notably James Brown), and that they consciously incorporated some of its beats. “Planet Rock” is a great example of how seamlessly they fuse together. \n\nBut the Germans' biggest mark on American electronic music has to be on Detroit. With the city's industrial peak still fresh in its residents' memory (leaving them fascinated with technology) and with a healthy dose of Funk, Post-Punk and German electronic music, Motor City became the birthplace of Electro and Techno (cousin genres). I come back to the famous quote from Techno pioneer Derrick May in describing the old Detroit sound: “_...like if George Clinton _\\[of Funk group, Parliament]_ and Kraftwerk were caught in an elevator, with only a sequencer to keep them company_.” And if that scenario would ever happen, maybe the results would sound something like Cybotron's 1983 single, “Clear”. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Cybotron - Clear\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fGqiBFqWCTU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"(to compare) Kraftwerk - Computer World 2 \" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuuR9hL4pgM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nThe 90s saw a 2nd wave of Detroit producers influenced by the “Belleville Three”, the Techno and Electro originators – Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson and Juan Atkins. The Electro/Techno Duo Drexciya explored this sound further. The titles of their tracks and releases evoke an imaginary, futuristic, underwater society. One of them, “Aquabahn”, references the title of Kraftwerk's most known piece, “Autobahn”. But their music already hints at a Kraftwerk connection. Listen to their “Wavejumper” track, from their 1995 EP release, _Aquatic Invasion_: a funked-out, sped-up, Kraftwerk-esque jam.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Drexciya - Wavejumper\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2M1S_4fW_JE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nRecently, maybe because of Techno fatigue seeping in, Electro has shown up again on people's radar – and mine also. One of my favourite current producers in the genre is the Glasgow-based Galaxian. If Kraftwerk were optimistic futurists, reconciling Nature and Technology, Man and Machine, Galaxian goes the other way, evoking a dystopian, maybe even apocalyptic, future. The producer has never mentioned any affinities for the German group, but the title of his track “From Glasgow to Detroit”, gives us a hint of there being an indirect musical lineage.  As his track “Dosing the Population” shows, some musical resemblances are there: vocals filtered through machines; the cold, thin, repetitive, drum-programming;  an Electro beat pattern; the synth chords; the high-pitched bleeps and bloops. But, of course, if Kraftwerk's music is generally soothing, then Galaxian's is frenzied, pushing the sound to higher speeds (just over 150 bpm) and putting in an overwhelming bass line. Kraftwerk in a chaotic world.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Galaxian - Dosing The Population\" iframe={<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1194402259/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://lowerparts.bandcamp.com/album/dosing-the-population\">Dosing The Population by Galaxian</a></iframe>} />\n\nLet's step away from dance music for a moment. Kraftwerk are also known for being a massive influence on the Synthpop genre, displaying a flair for pop sensibilities, incorporating melodic elements of _Schlager _(a genre of German pop music) into their compositions.  In _The Man Machine_, _Radio-Activity_ and _Computer World_, there are some tracks that can be classified as being “pop songs”. And while their music has definitely influenced 80s artists like Gary Numan, I thought we'd listen to a more recent Synthpop act, Junior Boys. The Canadian duo's 2004 debut release _Exit Boys_, adopts a Kraftwerk-esque  drum-machine percussion and bright analog synths, with a minimalist approach for the arrangements,  and adding their own touch of modern RnB vocals. \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Junior Boys - Bellona\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GD0Kktjw7eg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - The Model\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzIY9iiAbfs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nKraftwerk's DNA also finds itself in IDM (“Intelligent Dance Music”; yes, seriously), an umbrella term  for all electronic music taking elements of Techno and Electro, but putting it out of the context of the dance and making music for home-listening, with “more open-ended structures and possibilities”. Although the music can have a beat, IDM is more about creating a mood than a danceable groove, if you will. Last year saw the release of two 7th Plain compilations,  with music in the vein of IDM. And the vibe he establishes in his own work makes me think of Kraftwerk's.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Kometenmelodie 1\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYPILS3jhHQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Metropolis\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXTBGB2cKAk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The 7th Plain - I Think I Think Too Much\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qQdGY1T6eE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The 7th Plain - Reality of Space\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-F4QnvCPyMk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nIf Kraftwerk, following in the footsteps of German and French Electro-Acoustique musicians, would sometimes include re-creations of machine sounds into their music (like at the start of their _Radio-Activity_ album and at the beginning of “Pocket Calculator”), Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda made it his entire aesthetic, aiming to make “glitch” music. His 2005 album [_Dataplex _](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhfZk1llUo)is composed almost entirely of skittering bleeps and bloops, and glitch and machine noises,  all set up in discernible beat patterns. As the album goes on, ambient sounds are also introduced, like in his 10-minute track “data.matrix”. (**\\*\\*Watch out for your ears!\\*\\***)\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ryoji Ikeda - data.matrix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5hhFMSAuf4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nEven before Detroit producers were making Kraftwerk-inspired dance jams, the group's music had already some success on American dance floors, as New York House Djs in the late 70s had “Metal on Metal” in their record bag, with the track being a hit among the clubbers. The track itself is a dubbed out, instrumental version of the track that precedes it, “Trans-Europe Express”. Maybe sensing its club potential, Detroit's Carl Craig would make a re-imagining of it in his “Mind of a Machine”, a deep, four-to-the-floor Techno cut. Curiously, it begins with the sounds of a car being started, maybe in a callback to “Autobahn” (which starts the same way).\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kraftwerk - Trans-Europe Express + Metal on Metal\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FaBAU-8JIb8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Carl Craig - Mind of a Machine\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8N8MnQzuGk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nLastly, continuing on that Techno vibe, we'll finish with one of their countrymen, Ben Klock. A resident DJ at Berlin's Berghain (probably one of the most prestigious clubs in the world), Klock became popular at the turn of the decade for his selection of “pure”, “warm” Techno while adding his own mixing flair at the decks. Outside of the American Midwest, the Germans, alongside the British, were the first to “get” Techno, recognizing the 70s German electronic elements it had coded within it. _Berghain 04 _ was the mix CD which introduced me to the DJ. The drum-machine influence is quite apparent, as Klock goes for more “minimalist” tracks; sometimes with washes of white-noise, bleeps and bloops, and machine-manipulated vocal samples; sometimes with repetitious melodic lines and bright synths. The steady beat also recalls Kraftwerk's _motorik_, steady pulse that they had adopted from 70s Krautrock and, as previously mentioned, American RnB and Funk. And, of course, he doesn't forget the Detroit connection, including Rolando's (also from Detroit) “De Cago” which has sampled vocals repeating “_Detroit! Chicago!_”.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ben Klock - Berghain 04\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMNFX1diOwI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />","name":"20190118_kraftwerk-music-endless","urlPath":"/article/20190118_kraftwerk-music-endless"},{"publicationDate":"Jan 07, 2019","title":"(Some) Favourites of 2018","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/title-image-1-.jpg","category":"MIXES","summary":"From dub minimalism to percussive energy, the underground bass scene continued to produce great music in 2018.

Looking back, I think we aught to say that it was yet another great year for music. And I've been able to document some of it, here at The Next Groove. At mid-year, I made [a list](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181201_list-current-favourite-mixes-of-2018) of my favourite mixes of the year up until that point. Then, I made myself a scorching-hot [dancehall playlist](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_reggae-gold-no-ragga-song-spesh), the _Ragga Song Spesh_, that served as a substitute for this year's lacking Reggae Gold release, and also for the defunct Ragga Ragga Ragga compilation series. Later on, we took a look at this year's excellent [Drum n Bass compilations](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181126_the-past-is-now-drum-n-bass-edition) (from the old-school to the forward thinking).

But seeing as those types of music are largely ignored by writers, critics, journalists, etc, from the hip sites and zines, I'm more than happy to have done my part in documenting what 2018 had the best to offer, however small a part it was. Mostly, we should be thanking all of the Youtube and Soundcloud channels, online music shops, and specialized music forums and subreddits that help us in discovering new music and in keeping track of everything.\n\nWhile I had thought that my last list would be the only “look-back” that I'd make, putting it together really gave me the itch to make another entry to the Showcase Mixes series. This one, a 23-track, hour-long overview of some my favourite electronic music of 2018.\n\n# The Mix\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"2018 Favourites\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/555227394&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\n\\*tracklist available at end of article\n\nUnlike my previous entries, this one isn't focused on one particular artist or genre. Instead, I selected from the whole diaspora of the “130 sound” of current UK Bass/Hardcore music. (Which I talk about in [this article](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_uk-techno-bass-percussion-bass-hard-drums-the-new-hardcore)). However, these aren't necessarily my absolute favourite tracks from that sound. A lot of them had to be added, cut, re-added, re-cut, etc. Two important things were also taken into account: 1) variety, and 2) the flow of the mix. \n\nThis past year, I was a regular listener of Livity Sound's monthly 2-hour shows on NTS Radio. Peverelist, the label boss, who's usually behind the decks for the first hour, likes to start things off with mellow, dubby tracks. I do the same as him here, easing things in with Henry Greenleaf's “In Same”, Patrick Flint's “Lean In” and M//R's “Among the Methods”: syncopated, minimalist, bass-heavy, dubby goodness. The mix then picks up with some tracks from old favourites (Peverelist and Lamont) and new discoveries (R.O.S.H. and Yaleesa Hall). The remixes for Museum's “The List” - a muscular, weighty Techno track with deformed LFOs – and Jonny L's classic “Piper” - with Peverelist's signature offbeat, bouncy subbass – are definitely in my top 10 of 2018 (if I had to make a list of individual tracks).\n\nThe midpoint mellows in a bit with Hodge's and Ishan Sound trap and grime influenced, cloud-y Dubstep beat, before Bash & T's (aka Julio Bashmore & T.Williams) deep Funky track, “EC”, picks up the energy again to start the second part of the mix, focusing on the more percussive end of the “130 sound” - from UK Funky, to Gqom (“Going Modd”), to Hard Drum (“Airplane Mode” and “2nd Guessing”), to a more tribal affair that recalls early-Dubstep (Szare's “Miner”), to anything in-between that can't be precisely classified. Finally the mix ends two ravey cuts: Mark Force's remix of Roska's classic UK Funky track “Feeline”; and JABES' heavy and ethereal “iKEA SUMMERS”. Both of them, again, unclassifiable.\n\nI'm happy with the mix, overall. It's representative of my current tastes, and it should give listeners a good idea of where underground bass and electronic club music is headed right now.\n\n**Tracklist**\n\n0:00 - Henry Greenleaf - In Same\n\n3:00 - Patrick Flint - Lean In\n\n5:56 - M//R - Among the Methods\n\n9:03 - Appleblim - Vurstep (Shed Remix)\n\n11:56 - R.O.S.H. - Will I Make the Turn\n\n15:26 - Jonny L - Piper (Peverelist Remix)\n\n17:41 - Museum - The List (Yaleesa Hall Remix)\n\n20:56 - Lamont - Dope\n\n23:56 - Sensei - Tension\n\n27:56 - Hodge & Ishan Sound - C5\n\n30:10 - Bash & T - EC\n\n32:41 - Ice Viper - Perfect Swimmer\n\n33:56 - DJ Lag & Epic B - Going Modd\n\n36:04 - Mistareez - Residue\n\n38:30 - Neana - Neans Anthem\n\n41:21 - Akito & Famous Eno - Airplane Mode\n\n42:45 - Martyn Bootyspoon - Steam\n\n44:17 - Noire - 2nd Guessin'\n\n47:00 - Lava Dome - Closer (Galtier Remix)\n\n48:50 - Akito - Wake Me Up in Paris\n\n51:00 - Szare - Miner\n\n52:30 - Roska - Feeline (Mark Force Remix)\n\n54:50 - JABES - iKEA SUMMERS","name":"20190107_-some-favourites-of-2018","urlPath":"/article/20190107_-some-favourites-of-2018"}],"links":{"previousPage":null,"nextPage":"/page/2"}}
