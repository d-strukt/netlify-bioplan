Do you remember when Nights Slugs sounded like the future? When Future Garage was still a thing? When the Butterz crew initiated the \"Grime Revival\"? When Marcell Detmann and Ben Klock were making techno cool again? When the aggro, \"bro\" side of Dubstep spearheaded the global takeover of festival EDM culture?\n\nA last one: Do you remember when Swamp 81 was one of the coolest, trendiest labels and crews in underground electronic music?\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nSwamp 81 was founded in the late 2000s by DMZ member and Dubstep pioneer, Loefah. Discouraged by the direction the genre had taken, he started his new label in order to push a sound that aligned itself more with his tastes. The first few releases - notably from Kryptic Minds - are characterized by a return to Dubstep's \"roots\" (the noisy, aggressive sound was overtaking the scene by then) : the dark and minimal, halftime style.\n\nBut the label took a sudden turn in 2010 with its 5th release: **Addison Groove**'s (aka **Headhunter**) 12\" record with \"Footcrab\" (and \"Dumbshit\" on the B-side). It became an immediate hit in the underground. The Juke-inspired, lo-fi, bassy, drum-machine track sounded like nothing else in Dubstep.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Addison Groove - Footcrab\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWfiog1Ure4\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nThe British had just discovered (or re-discovered) America's \"Ghetto Bass\" music from the 90s: Starting with Juke and Footwork, then with Ghettotech and Ghetto House; all from Detroit and Chicago. Also worth mentioning, Trap's 808-infused beats was beginning its ascension right about then.\n\nQuickly, Loefah's interests shifted towards this \"drum-machine\" styled bass music, exploring the past while trying to push fresh, new sounds. Hyped by the two most influential music journals in underground electronic music, Fact Magazine and Resident Advisor, the label also became an influential force. In the early 2010s, Loefah was joined by like-minded producers such as the Hessle Audio co-founder Ramadanman (now known as Pearson Sound), Addison Groove, Mickey Pearce, UK Garage legend Zed Bias, Paleman, Joy Orbison...\n\nAnd, of course, **Boddika**.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nBoddika's musical origins are in Drum N Bass, as one-half of** Instra:mental**. The duo was active in the 2000s, initially pushing a sound reminiscent of Metalheadz, and collaborating with Drum N Bass pioneers and heroes, Source Direct and Jonny L. It was good music, but it wasn't anything that distinguished itself from what had been done, and what was being done, in the genre. However, by the end of the decade, they started to explore a more moody, emotional and sometimes cinematic side to their style. Throughout 2009, Jon Convex (aka Kid Drama), the other half of Instra:mental, did a series of podcasts with D-Bridge, taking this style further and further. It came to be known as the \"Autonomic\" sound, which was the name of the podcast.\n (A great write-up of this is done [here](https://godisnolongeradj.wordpress.com/2017/01/25/tracks-i-wish-id-written-issue-8-instramental-photograph/))\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Instra:mental - Sakura\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Kp_0kiSKaA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nThe duo also ventured out of Drum N Bass, going into Electro, Techno and House territory,  dropping all the way down to the 130-140 bpm range. Their last big hurrah before their split was a career-defining LP,** Resolution 653**, released in 2011, in which they leaned towards an experimental Electro and Techno sound. By then, they had fully assumed a \"drum-machine\" sound,  taking it to its extremes. Although the duo split, Boddika made this sound his own. In Swamp 81, he found a place were he could foster it. (He also released music on other labels such as Sunklo, \\[NakedLunch], and his own Nonplus+.)\n\n## The Mix\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Boddika Showcase Mix\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/487023597&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n_The tracklist is at the end of the article._\n\nThis showcase starts with two Instra:mental tracks, \"Forbidden\" and \"Futurist\", in order to establish a contrast with the rest of the mix. The first one, while being in the 130 bpm range, is incredibly reminiscent of Boddika's Drum N Bass roots. The second is a good example of the \"Autonomic\" vibe they were doing. Notice how, in \"Forbidden\", the production has a warm tone to it: it's very clean-sounding and polished. In \"Futurist\", their goal is to create a sort of moody reverie, with a \"lush\" production style. Then, \"Faint\", a collaboration with two Swamp 81 label-mates, goes straight into what I call \"Drum-Machine Music\", as practiced by Boddika and the rest of Don Loefah' crew.\n\nGenerally, in electronic music , the machines (or the plug-ins) used to create the music  are tools that serve a whole. Each sound emitted by these machines are building blocks for a composition. Especially now, and recently, everything has to be \"polished\", rounded. The aesthetic is the mood this \"whole\", the composition, creates. \n\nBut with Boddika, the machine is the aesthetic. The machine manifests itself, calls attention to itself. Its textures and artificiality are made evident. Notice the raw, unpolished drum sounds throughout the mix, and the sharp hi-hats. Almost all of the drum sounds are dry (\"dry\" as in \"no reverb at all\"). In \"Rubba\", even the snares are ridiculously snappy. If UK Garage was all about off-beat swing, then Boddika has the _swing _dial turned all the way down. It's as if his beat patterns are limited to what an old drum-machine's interface is able to do. The music sounds very \"modern\", but, like listening to an old Electro track, it's incredibly obvious that a machine is making this sound.\n\nThis \"drum-machine\" approach affects everything. Notice the synths, how they're shaped into twisted, sometimes atonal, forms, going in and out through clumsily applied filters and dials, having a life of their own,  and almost ignoring the notion of harmony. Just like the hi-hats, they're razor-sharp and direct. \"You Tell Me\" takes this aesthetic to its extreme, with its off-key melodies and the ear-bleeding LFOs being torn apart. And notice the drum-machine jam that is** \"**Beats Me\", in which the backing speech sample (a sensual voice like in an old Chicago House track) is manipulated and deformed as to become incomprehensible. Again, it's the machine, the artificial nature of the music, that is highlighted. It directs and informs the composition.\n\nAll of this is done deliberately. As we have seen, Boddika is able to create a \"polished\" sound if he wants to. But his goal, in the early 2010s, was to create raw and immediate beats, influenced by American \"Ghetto Bass\" music and the UK Hardcore's fixation on the groove (percussion and bass dynamic).\n\nThe mix ends with the one-two punch assault of \"In Here\" and \"More Maim\". Both were released in 2014 on the same 12\" record on Sunklo (his and Joy Orbison's label where they released their collaborations). And both represent, at least for me, the end of Boddika's drum-machine era. Since then, he has transitioned into to a more by-the-numbers techno sound, focusing on releasing other people's music on his own Nonplus+ label.\n\nThis aesthetic in dance music isn't exclusive to him. Of course, he takes it to another level, but it's an approach others have also done, whether in [Dancehall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4KFkgloz0k), in [House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfpoXeOnfbg), or [Dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cWgvo6TtZQ). The Swamp 81 crew were simply some of the practitioners.\n\nTracklist:\n\n<SpecialText align=\"undefined\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\n* _00:00_\n  * Instra:mental - Forbidden (Apple Pips)\n* _02:57 _\n  * Instra:mental - Futurist (NakedLunch)\n* _05:32_\n  * Joy Orbison, Boddika & Pearson Sound - Faint (Sunklo)\n* _06:46_\n  * Boddika - Crack (Swamp 81)\n* _08:44_\n  * Boddika - Syn Chron (NakedLunch)\n* _11:12_\n  * Boddika - 2727 (Swamp 81)\n* _14:00_\n  * Boddika - Basement (Swamp 81)\n* _15:47 _\n  * Boddika - You Tell Me (Nonplus)\n* _19:26_\n  * Boddika - Beats Me (Nonplus)\n* _21:00_\n  * Boddika - Rubba (Swamp 81)\n* _23:37_\n  * Joy Orbison & Boddika - In Here (Sunklo)\n* _26:20_\n  * Joy Orbison & Boddika - More Maim (Sunklo)\n\n![The man himself](/cms-content/uploads/boddika02.jpg)","name":"20181123_showcase-mix-boddika-s-drum-machine-music","urlPath":"/article/20181123_showcase-mix-boddika-s-drum-machine-music"},{"publicationDate":"Aug 15, 2018","title":"Mala's Bass Mutations","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/mala.jpg","category":"MIXES","summary":"Although his music continues to be revered in the underground Dubstep scene, Mala's music still sounds unlike anything else in it. ","body":"Earlier in the year, Red Bull Music wrote an article, stating: \"[Why dubstep is back at the cutting edge in 2018](https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/dubstep-back-at-cutting-edge)\".\n\nAnd Plastician, one of the scene's originators, thinks it might be [flourishing soon](https://twitter.com/Plastician/status/969288617880375296), or even right now.\n\nEver since the Brostep explosion dissipated and the style was relegated to the margins of the EDM/Festival culture, the underground Dubstep scene, keeping the spirit of the original sound alive, kept trudging on. The \"Dungeon Sound\" came and went. Soon after, around four years ago or so, a new school of producers started playing with new sound palettes, taking cues from other genres like Halftime Drum n Bass, Riddim, Grime, and Trap, but always staying within the familiar template. The music is essentially the same: stripped-back, spaced-out beats.; leftfield inclinations; nd, of course, a hefty, low-end subbass. All at around 140 bpm.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Chokez - Konichiwa\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8WeM7iVank\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd while this new school has brought some needed freshness to the genre, the strict adherence to the halftime beat pattern  (i.e. accentuated first and third beat on every measure; typically with a kick on the first and a snare on the third) makes me wish that there was more rhythmic variety. The underground Dubstep scene has always given itself the mandate of \"keeping the original sound alive\", while worshiping the early players. But, ironically, rhythmic variety is a lesson they could draw from the early days, from before everyone and their mothers started doing the halftime beat.\n\nEnter **Mala**.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Mala is one half of the Digital Mystikz (the other half being his childhood friend, Coki). With their other two friends  (Loefah and Sgt Pokes), they formed DMZ - a crew, a label and, eventually, a club night. This South London quartet has always been given the credit in having the biggest part in shaping the Dubstep sound. I don't think that's entirely accurate, but, certainly, when it comes to that older era, no one is more celebrated than them.\n\n![The DMZ gang](/cms-content/uploads/mala02.jpg)\n\nWhile Mala isn't my favourite producer from that time (that would be either Loefah or D1), I feel that his discography gives a great glimpse into why Dubstep was such a great genre in its genesis. I think now is a good time to revisit Mala's early Dubstep explorations (from around 2003-5).\n\nDubstep hadn't yet become formulaic back then. There were two rules: around 140 bpm (emphasis on \"around\") and subbass. That was it. People brought they're own styles to the table. Influences ranged from UK Garage - notably its 2-Step variant (hence the \"step\" in \"dubstep) - , Jungle, Drum n Bass, Minimal Techno, Broken Beat, Dancehall and Dub Reggae.\n\nMala and Loefah have stated in interviews that, at the time, they were simply looking for something new, something fresh and exciting. It wasn't necessarily to invent or come up with a new genre, but to participate in a scene that encouraged new ideas, at a time when Drum N Bass, UK Garage, House and Techno had become, according to them, creatively stagnant.\n\n# The mix\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mala Showcase Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?feed=%2Fmordak%2Fmala-showcase-mix%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nSo here's a showcase mix of Mala's music. A selection of some of my favourite beats of his that, I feel, give a good idea of his overall sound. Also note that a lot of tracks were released under the \"Digital Mystikz\" moniker, but the duo rarely produced tracks together. These are all Mala productions.\n _(*a tracklist is provided at the end of the article)_\n\nHis drum sounds have an earthy tone to them, sometimes even going for a tribal feel. Compared to almost all electronic music, they lack a certain polish, but their _rawness _gives them a lot of character, a lot of grit. They're accompanied by shuffling, offbeat hi-hats and an array of percussive sounds. And all of that is propelled by a subbass made for sound systems.\n\nThe music is dark and haunting; meditative and apocalyptic. Notice the melancholic instrumental samples paired with the Jah/rastafarian vocals. And notice the ominous piano notes in **Bury Da Bwoy**. But Mala's groove gives it a dynamic energy that still sounds unique, and that works for both the skankers at the rave and the head nodders listening at home.\n\nThe second half  of the mix, especially, showcases the rhythmic variety that Mala practices. Notice how in tracks like **Neverland**, **Awake** and **Da Wrath**, it isn't the first and third beats of every measure that are accentuated. The music has more of a \"jump-up\" feel rather than a halftime one.\n\nTracks like **Conference** and **Walkin' With Jah** go into some warped, tribal affair and broken beat patterns. The former making use of hand-slapped afro-percussion samples. And the latter, using the sounds of distant, rolling tribal drums, and all of it backed-up by a gurgling, cavernous subbass leading to atonal strings.\n\nIn the early 2000s, music like this made people think about what rave music could be, and what electronic music could be. By revisiting early Dubstep, even the current players could think about what Dubstep can be, and, I hope, free themselves from the stranglehold of the formulaic halftime beat pattern.\n\nLastly, Mala's music, putting the emphasis on the percussion and bass, also fits with the current trend of \"Percussion/Bass\" music of the underground UK scene, showing how the same sort of musical tendencies, elements and ideas can come out in new genres with fresh results. Anyone who enjoys the current tribal and percussive sound should find something that they like in, not only Mala's, but early Dubstep's body of work.\n\n<Tracklist tracksStr={[{\"startTime\":\"00:00\",\"artist\":\"Mala\",\"trackName\":\"Changes\"},{\"startTime\":\"04:36\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Misty Winter\"},{\"startTime\":\"07:02\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Chainba\"},{\"startTime\":\"09:22\",\"artist\":\"Mala\",\"trackName\":\"Bury Da Bwoy\"},{\"startTime\":\"11:54\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Neverland\"},{\"startTime\":\"14:53\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Awake\"},{\"startTime\":\"18:06\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Conference\"},{\"startTime\":\"20:50\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Da Wrath\"},{\"startTime\":\"23:07\",\"artist\":\"Digital Mystikz\",\"trackName\":\"Walkin' with Jah\"},{\"startTime\":\"26:00\",\"artist\":\"Mala\",\"trackName\":\"Alicia\"}]} />","name":"20181201_malas-bass-mutations","urlPath":"/article/20181201_malas-bass-mutations"},{"publicationDate":"Aug 08, 2018","title":"List - Current Favourite Mixes of 2018","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/playlist_mid2018.png","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"A little late for a mid-year roundup, I know, but that won't keep me from sharing the mixes I've been feeling these past months.","body":"## Vromm - CBR Podcast 3:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Vromm - CBR Podcast 3\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/461353497&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n## Peverelist w/ (MC) Koast - Tectonic Takeover on Radar Radio:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Peverelist w/ (MC) Koast - Tectonic Takeover on Radar Radio\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FRadarRadioLDN%2Fpeverelist-w-koast-tectonic-takeover-11th-february-2018%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n## Madam X - Lab LDN (Mixmag):\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Madam X - Lab LDN (Mixmag)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay;

Today, the Hardcore sound is prolonged by a new wave of bass and percussion music.\n","body":"I'd like to expand on my thoughts in the \"[What is the New Hardcore?](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181104_what-is-the-new-hardcore)\" article - which ended with the \"_I don't know_\" remark - by reasserting two possible answers that I had given:\n\n> _**\"... Is it in the rolling, subbass-y beats of techno-meets-dubstep being pushed out by Kaizen, Livity Sound, Version, Timedance, etc? \\[...] Is it in the highly percussive, bassy works of labels like Nervous Horizon, Sans Absence? ...\"\n> **_\n\nThose two styles, I think, represent the Hardcore sound right now. And as is usual with new styles of music, they have no official names, as they are barely discernible scenes in the immense, ever-growing and constantly-morphing world of electronic music.\n\nThe first one is, in a practical sense, techno, but it's a \"UKifed\" version of  techno. Generally called \"bass\" and/or categorized as \"uk techno\", it's the continuation of the early sound of [South London-era Dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEJG9L-n_tE) (circa 2003-5),to my ears. The most important labels in shaping this style are Swamp81, Livity Sound and Hessle Audio. Other labels pushing this sound include: Kaizen, Mistry, Timedance, Durkle Disco, Jelly Bean Farm, Artifice Music, Circular Jaw, etc, etc.\n\nThe second one is very percussive - almost tribal-like - with influences from UK Funky, Gqom and even Soca. On Soundcloud, most often than not, \"percussion bass\" and \"hard drum(s)\" tags are used to categorize the uploaded mixes and tracks. The most prominent labels are Nervous Horizon and Sans Absence.\n\nJust like Dubstep and Grime were once both part of the \"140 sound\" diaspora in the early 2000s (before becoming crystallized genres onto their own), so should \"UK Techno\" and \"Percussion Bass\" be considered as being part of the same \"bass\" diaspora of the current \"UK\" scene. I put \"UK\" in quotation marks because, although the sound still revolves around the UK soundsystem tradition of \"Hardcore\", people from all over the world practice it already.\n\nTypically around 120 to 130 bpm, the music is_ (sub)bassy_ and _percussively _inclined. What matters here is creating a rude, weighty groove - and that is the defining characteristic. A track's structure usually follows the conventions of Hardcore (as seen in Drum N Bass and Dubstep) - 1) an intro, 2) a drop, 3) a bridge and  4) a second drop.\n\nIt can be tribal and ostentatious, or meditative and moody (or anything in-between). It can put the drums at the forefront of the mix, or let the subbass breathe out.  It can be influenced by the thumping percussion of Gqom and Soca, the deep pulse of Techno, or the bass dread of early Dubstep. And when it comes to beat patterns, it can throw some Baltimore Club and Vogue in there too, for good measure. Like Jungle and Drum n Bass at their inception, it's a bastard sound, taking cues from everywhere, respective of current tastes.\n\nOk, but what does it sound like? Or, better put, what can it sound like? Remember, no formula is set in stone yet, so let's look at some examples...\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n♪\n\nFirst, a perfect example of  \"UK techno\": the duo **Silas and Snare**'s \"Biometric\" on the Manchester-based label Kaizen. Heavy and prominent syncopated kicks, a sliding subbass (like in old-school Dubstep), and Techno synths:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Silas & Snare - Biometric\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1401239276/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3423876283/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://kaizenltd.bandcamp.com/album/biometric\">Biometric by Silas & Snare</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nSecond, a perfect example of \"Percussion Bass\" (or \"Hard Drums\"), this one from London-based label, Sans Absence.

I look back at one the first electronic albums I've loved, and see where it stands today.","body":"I remember, oh about 11 or 12 years ago, when I had just taken the plunge into the world of music geekdom, reading reviews and articles,  and seeking out new artists and albums to add on my endless \"to listen\" list, I had noticed that this album was often mentioned as a landmark work from the 90s. Admittedly, I also remember ignoring it for the simple fact that the cover put me off (and I still stand by my opinion that it is an ugly cover). But after listening to DJ Shadow's renowned _Endtroducing _(and loving it), and upon further reading, I learned that _Mezzanine _is regarded as one of the three masterpieces of the Trip-Hop genre (with Portishead's Dummy completing the trio).\n\nMezzanine was definitely a grower. At just over the hour-long mark, it was then one of the longest albums I had listened to. It's essentially an hour-long listen of slow-tempo'd tracks, with most of them taking their time to build. And I had not yet developed the patience as a listener that I have today. However, right off the bat, there was no denying the strength of the first four tracks. Angel, especially, remains one of the most memorable openers: the ominous-yet-sexy bassline and riff,  the reverent vocals singing \"You are my angel/Come from way above/To bring me love\", and the rock-out crescendo are hard to forget.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/massive-attack-2.jpg)\n\nThere is an undeniable sensuality to the music, what with the slow, prominent basslines, the sleazy riffs, the whispered male vocals and the soft, angelic female vocals. There's a heavy sense of desire, of fulfilled and unfulfilled love and intimacy. But the brooding bass and the dubwise effects give this album some sense of claustrophobia and dread underlying the lyricism, itself revolving around the themes of love, self-awareness, self-doubt, alienation and deception:\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n_\"I need a little love to ease the pain_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n_You're not my savior, but I still won't go_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n_I could fake it, but I still want more_\n\nFor my money, Mezzanine is still an exceptional album, but where does it stand now, 20 years later? Where does it fit in the pantheon of electronic music, that has flourished exponentially this last decade?\n\nI feel like it has since been overshadowed by Burial's early work, which showcases a blend of the bass dread from Croydon-era Dubstep, with the melancholic vocal samples manipulated like those in a Todd Edwards record - a combination which seems to resonate more with today's young generation. Even though Massive Attack's music shares some fundamental elements with that of Burial's (namely, the Dub Reggae influence and the melancholic vibe), the latter is able to exert the cathartic reverberations of dance music and the UK rave music sound. This, I think, is more in line with today's tastes. What's more, I think that younger listeners are more interested in discovering House, Techno, Jungle, Garage, etc, from the 90s than to listen to the rockist canon of album-oriented, \"acceptable\" electronic music that has, at this point, little new to offer.  \n\nNotably, Mezzanine is regarded as the last great Trip-Hop album. I've even read people calling this the final nail in the coffin for the genre. Because, the sentiment goes:_ how do you top this? _ And even though there have been new Trip-Hop acts that have sprung up in the new millennium, the genre remains attached to the 90s in the general consciousness (like Grunge is). In the mid-2000s, I think people still had hope that the genre would make a comeback, based on the strength of this, Tricky's and Portihead's works. It never did, of course.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/massive-attack-3.jpg)\n\nMassive Attack did eventually make a comeback after a long hiatus. However, they have never been able to match this album. The music in this album has ambition, but it is never too ostentatious in its production tricks. This approach has permitted it to age gracefully. If this album sounds like a 90s album, it's because the Trip-Hop sound happens to be heavily influenced by Boom Bap (even then, only in regards to drum programming). Lastly,  its strength lies simply in its memorable songwriting. It might take a little patience to soak it in, but once the music grabs you, it never really lets go. I listen to it maybe once every two years now, but I'd be lying if I said that bits and pieces of this album don't pop into my head every now and then.\n\n__","name":"20181123_20-years-later-massive-attack-mezzanine","urlPath":"/article/20181123_20-years-later-massive-attack-mezzanine"},{"publicationDate":"Jul 31, 2018","title":"What Is the New Hardcore?","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/pic01.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"The genesis of Rave in the UK shaped the \"Hardcore\" sound, from which Jungle and Drum N Bass are derived. What is it? And how does it manifest itself today?","body":"During the 90s, British music journalist Simon Reynolds chronicled his experience with UK Rave music, witnessing its genesis during the Second Summer of Love. From the squelching sounds of Acid House, to the hefty breaks of  ['Ardcore Techno](https://youtu.be/wtJoAtXtad4), to the kinetic amen manipulation of [Jungle](https://youtu.be/YaKEGzTYnik), and futuristic bass exploitation of [Drum N Bass](https://youtu.be/ufcRRtRbSfs), he, as many others, witnessed at first-hand the rapid pace at which rave music evolved from '88 to '95 (that's four genres in seven years, think about it) - shaped in warehouse and open-field parties, infiltrating clubs and pirate radio, and taking over the UK's youth.\n\nBorrowing elements of American music (House, Techno, Electro and Hip Hop), Jamaican music (Dub Reggae and Dancehall), and European music (New Beat), Hardcore, aka Breakbeat Techno and Breakbeat Hardcore, initiated a musical tradition recognized by some as the \"Hardcore Sound\". In his Red Bull Music Academy appearance, dubstep pioneer and Hyperdub label-head Kode9 describes it succinctly: \"_The hardcore sound came when electronic music clashed with Jamaican soundsystem culture in London_\". \n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/title.jpg)\n\nHardcore was the result of a youth thirsty for all kinds of new dance music (even \"getting\" Techno before most Americans did ). It was the end-result of a youth having been exposed to Jamaican music, as it was supposedly not unusual to hear the heavy rumble of the bass coming out the sound systems when strolling around certain areas of London.\n\nHardcore was not just the sound itself, it was also the presentation: The DJ (selector) and the MC (toaster), the bass bins, the pull-ups (rewinds), the DJs competing and scrambling for \"dubplates\" (the exclusives, the VIP versions,  the unreleased tracks cut on 10\" acetate records). Hardcore re-contextualized these Jamaican musical traditions in its new, twisted form of electronic dance music. It was normal to hear the MC, possibly of Caribbean origins, hyping up the crowd over the drum breaks, the subbass and the rave stabs. The British created their own brand of sound system culture.\n\nSimon Reynolds observed that Jungle and Drum N Bass, both derivations of Hardcore, took over its mantle of hybridity and innovation, keeping some of its elements, adding new ones, but always staying in the UK soundsystem scene. Even though they were new genres, they were a continuation of the Hardcore sound. It defined underground club music and pirate radio in London and, as we now know, the sound lived on in the genres of the new millennium. As Londoners got a hold of [Garage House](https://youtu.be/r8uKbprFjIE) from New York, they wasted no time in morphing it into their own style. The swiveling swing of the 2-Step variant of UK Garage was the perfect host for the syncopation and bouncing subbass introduced during the Jungle era: [sample](https://youtu.be/G3fE-mNRFrs), [sample](https://youtu.be/FzEnST_vJiE), [sample](https://youtu.be/tjuynOikZkA).\n\nIn the early 2000s, Jungle and Drum N Bass - once on the bleeding-edge of, not just club music, but music in general - had become extremely formulaic, even a little sanitized. But from the 2-Step Garage scene, in London, there emerged two new genres that continued the tradition of Hardcore: Grime and Dubstep. \n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/pic02.jpg)\n\nIn Grime, the MCing tradition of UK dance/rave/soundsystem music took center-stage, as MCs arrived from the Jungle and Drum N Bass scenes, in which their roles had once been to complement the DJ's selection. In Dubstep, a small group of producers and DJs - from London, Bristol and Manchester - came together to push the bass mutations even further into a weirder, fresher style. That deep, rumbling subbass that was part of the London soundscape became the focal point of the genre, taking influences from 2-step Garage, Broken Beat, Minimal Techno, Dancehall, Drum N Bass and Dub Reggae.\n\nBy the mid to late 2000s, Bassline and Funky House (aka UK Funky) also made a sizable impact, the former pushing the sound of Speed Garage into more aggressive territories; and Funky, becoming some sort of mutation between House and Grime, mashed together with Afro-Carribean and West African club music. ([sample](https://youtu.be/l3TPRpgudtM)).\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nBut what now? Around 2010, as the more aggro side of Dubstep (pejoratively called \"Brostep\") started taking over the world,  a new sound was emerging from the underground. Labels like Hessle Audio, 3024, Swamp81, Punch Drunk, NonPlus, etc, took cues from House, Techno and Electro, blending them with the dubwise approach of old-school Dubstep. 140 bpm went down to 132, and eventually in the 120-130 bpm territory. But this short movement didn't last long, or, better put, it never truly gave way to a solidified, cohesive movement. Some continued it. A lot ended up doing formulaic House and Techno. Some even went back to Drum n Bass, or Dubstep. And others seem to change style every couple of years, going to genreless beats to other, unclassifiable, genreless beats, sometimes delving into borderline pastiches of what is considered trendy, but never really trying to blend the many influences in a seamless way, as Hardcore had once done.\n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/pic03.jpg)\n\nIf there's one thing that has defined underground electronic music in the 2010s, it's the new fluidity that artists now have. Gone are the days of forced musical rigidity in the DJ's set. Of course, there are still purists, and they will always be there. But the internet has expanded people's tastes, making them more aware of the past and present, letting them get involved in local and global music. And the new DJing equipment has opened up new possibilities, enabling a new school of DJs to swiftly and seamlessly execute tempo and genre switches, going from rolling techno, to electronic reggaeton beats, to distorted gabber, for example. \n\nAnd, as it is evident now, the toast MC's are almost gone, no longer an essential part of the music. When one does make an appearance, it's usually because it's a celebrated MC from the past. Also, I have to say that comments such as \"fuck this mc prick\" and \"shut up you mug\" found on Youtube and Soundcloud have possibly left their mark on the culture, or they could be hints of changed tastes.\n\nStill, we linger on with \"the roots\", content with keeping the \"original sounds\" of Grime, Dubstep and Drum n Bass alive. Recently, lo-fi house and outsider house have attracted new fans into the world of underground club music. What characterizes this music is, in my opinion, a sort of fixation on the past, a sort of old-school deep house revival. \n\n![](/cms-content/uploads/pic05.jpg)\n\nBut what is the new Hardcore? Has the sound been reinterpreted into a new genre? Is it in the rolling, subbass-y beats of techno-meets-dubstep being pushed out by Kaizen, Livity Sound, Version, Timedance, etc? Is it in this deconstructed, post-club, industrial-meets-reggaeton-meets-traps-meets-baltimore-club that has risen in these last three or so years? Is it in the highly percussive, bassy works of labels like Nervous Horizon, Sans Absence? Or is it in all of these at once?\n\nAnd to add to that, the \"UK sound\" isn't just the UK anymore, as artists from New York, Berlin, Los Angeles, Montreal, Amsterdam, Melbourne, etc, now make \"UK bass\" music.\n\nI don't even know.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Batu - Live @ Timedance 24.02.18, The White Hotel\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/416037318&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />","name":"20181104_what-is-the-new-hardcore","urlPath":"/article/20181104_what-is-the-new-hardcore"}],"links":{"previousPage":"/page/2","nextPage":null}}
