It's now time to have a quick look-back at the mixes I enjoyed and that have come out during the month of February. Yes, I know that we're into the second week of March and that I'm even later than I was last month.  But last month ended before I had realized that it had ended, and there were still some mixes that I wanted to listen before moving on to this month's output. Those couple of extra listens weren't particularly fruitful, though, so the list ended up being short, having one less entry than the last one. Nevertheless, each of these are great listens. Let's go.\n\n_\\* Oh shit, I've just realized that the Soca mix is from last week... It probably would've ended up on the March list anyways. The important thing is that it's good. That is all._\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Heatwave - Soca Season on Rinse FM\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Ftheheatwave%2Fsoca-season-on-rinse-fm%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nIf, like me, you've heard about this so-called \"Soca Season\" and asked yourself: \"When, exacly, is it Soca Season?\". And then you went on to google it and found no clear answers whatsoever (it seems like soca afficionados on forums aren't ever sure themselves...), well, now we know, at least for this year. It's just passed. \n\nGabriel Heatwave (whose King Tubby tribute mix made an appearance in last month's list) brings us the hits from this year's season of carnivals. There are some absolute gems here, like Patrice Robert's \"Like it Hot\", Nessa Preppy's \"Issa Snack\", and \"Party Start\" courtesy of Swappi & Ultimate Rejects. 1 hour of bright, upbeat goodness from the UK dancehall selector.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Szare - 2nd February 2019 (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fszare-2nd-february-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nI promised the sunshine, now here's the gloom, though it is no less frenetic. Szare, whose oriental-flavoured riddim \"Miner\" is one my favourite tracks from these last few months, plunges into colder, darker vibes, going from the minimal and industrial techno of Clouds, to twitchy idm-ish tribal affairs, to the deep dystopian roller of Kenya's Slikback. Szare's mix straddles the line between chin-stroking home-listening and neurotic danceabilty, staying engaging the whole way through. And it gets extra points for making me realize that I'm still not completely bored with the industrial and ebm sounds that you currently can't escape from in underground electronic music.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Trends B2B Boylan B2B DOK With Novelist & Manga St Hilare - PyroRadio - (04/02/2019)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEjDra2RY3A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nGrime hasn't been the flavour of the day for quite some time now, being recently usurped by the still-rising UK hip hop/UK drill/afroswing scene, but this 30-minute set gets everything right. It's got two of the best new age dj/producers (Trends and Boylan) behind the decks, and two of the best new age MCs on the mics. It's short  and sweet, the DJs keep the energy levels up, and they keep things surprising and exciting for the MCs, juggling between new age trappy sounds and bouncy, jump-up riddims that don't care if they sound ridiculous. Also, for my money, grime is at its best on live sets (as opposed to albums).\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Flora Yin-Wong | Keep Hush Live: Nice One Takeover\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U7jD_wZzxko\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nYou'll probably recognize the Keep Hush youtube channel, who seem to have taken it upon themselves to replicate the atmosphere of old Boiler Room circa 2010, pushing out underground UK sounds (without getting the deluge of downvotes from the house and techno purists that are now Boiler Room's main audience) . Although they don't promote new genres enough for my liking, their recordings have stayed consistent in quality.\n\nLast month, they invited over Flora Yin-Wong, who I know nothing about, to be honest. Admittedly, the first couple of minutes here are kind of dead lol. But boy does it pick up, with Nazar's ice-cold and heavy \"Airstrike\" beautifully setting the mood for the 100bpm (ish) section. The dancehall and reggaeton tempo has become a fixation for more and more underground djs and producers these last couple of years, and Flora shows us why. She ends her short set in style with some UK Funky/Hard Drum vibes.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kyam - Artist Mix #011 for Ronin Ordinance\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/569059542&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nSpeeding things up with some good ol' DnB. There isn't much info about Kyam. All I know is that he's released one of my favourite tracks of this year, so far, in his \"[VHX](https://soundcloud.com/kyamofficial/vhx)\", and that he seems to be good selector. Sure, he isn't re-inventing anything here. But in just under 1 hour, Kyam goes through various styles of deep, heavy Dnb and Jungle (as a commentator has already remarked), even adding in a hardcore techno/gabber track like if it was a Helkter Skelter set, and keeping things fresh the whole way through.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Yilan - Newtype Rhythms #72 - Special Guest Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/575029449&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n_His mix starts at around 44:30_\n\nA mix to promote his new release _Diaspora. _Yilan is a producer/dj from the UK who's focused on the deep techno sounds from over there, similar to the likes of Yak, Henry Greenleaf, Madam X... Here he's able to achieve a great balance between atmospheric vibes and heavy ones, having recourse to more than a handful of unreleased tracks, which includes Yak's tribal material in his \"Kaepora\", and a dangerous collab between Manga (yes, that same grime MC) and Mikes Drones & Padawan Sound.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"East Man - Stush!\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/575866695&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nWe started this list with some modern Soca, now let's end it with some old school 90s ragga/dancehall. For those that don't know, East Man is Anthony J Hart's (aka Basic Rhythm) alias under which he fleshes out a [revamped take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Dy8RQSjcs) on those old school, gritty, skeletal white label grime beats with his own \"cleaner\" production. There's no info about his \"Stush!\" mix, but to my ears, this seems to be a collection of proto-grime ragga tunes. You can hear it in the sparse arrangements with syncopated heavy drums and cold synths. Even some early grime MCs like God's Gift and MC Viper had a heavy ragga-influenced delivery style. Also, we can hear how these type of tunes _still _inform a lot of current underground UK bass music (like, say, Yilan's for example). Immortal sounds.","name":"20190312_carnival-sunshine-to-dystopian-pulses-february-mixes","urlPath":"/article/20190312_carnival-sunshine-to-dystopian-pulses-february-mixes"},{"publicationDate":"Mar 10, 2019","title":"Deep Skanking - Dubstep's Digitized Roots","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/title-image-compressed.png","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"I briefly talk about dubstep's sonic origins and share the playlist in which I collected \"proto-dubstep\" tracks available to stream on Spotify and Google Play. ","body":"O the glory days of Grooveshark. When I started to get into electronic music (around 2010 ) and dove straight into my first genre of choice, dubstep, Grooveshark was all I needed to embark on my deep exploration. You see, I discovered the genre mainly through the site: listening to all the classic stuff from the Digital Mystikz and Loefah; as well as everything from the classic labels such as Tectonic, Hotflush, Tempa, Dub Soldiers, Chestplate, DMZ; and on top of that, the influential mixes like the first two _Dubstep Allstars_ volumes, Skream's entry for _Watch the Ride_, and Caspa & Rusko's _Fabriclive 37_. It was all there.\n\nAfter it inevitably closed down, we've had to contend ourselves with a decentralized experience of listening to music: from Youtube, to Bandcamp, and Soundcloud; then on Spotify, Google Music, Deezer, or Tidal; and finally maybe on Beatport. And if all these options fail you in finding what you're looking for, well, you have to take up crime and look into unofficial venues. It truly leaves a sour taste in the mouth because Grooveshark proved that the technology and means are there to centralize music. Oh well.\n\nDiscovering electronic club music from before 2008 (ish) can sometimes be quite a hassle and lead to frustration. When it comes to club music (house, techno, dnb, jungle, garage, trance, etc, etc), most of it from before that year came out as singles or EPs on vinyl. If we aren't willing to shell out the money (prices go up fast with shipping fees), we have to hope that someone has uploaded a rip on Youtube or that a label has released digital versions of their backlog. Thankfully, both music collectors and labels have been hard at work this past decade,  so the gaps are receding.\n\nAll this rambling leads me to the point: I've recently made a playlist, available on both [Spotify ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AIeV1cAXEgG06uclrjJ3V)and [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXylEBAUu0Rl4TVzG75VzPKEWCCewMV4E2SiE-NdwvHe5L4RLqRus9QLgZRQiqjU01RbXoHED4zZPHLbwCeRQzLmGLo6MOw%3D%3D), that shares the same name as this article, _Deep Skanking: Dubstep's Digitized Roots_. By  “dubstep's roots” here, I don't mean the classic 2004-7ish material that I listed up top, but the pre-2004 music that shaped what eventually became what we now recognize as “dubstep”; back when the scene was centered around the “FWD>>” (pronounced “forward”) club night in London. \n\nMy goal for this playlist was to be able to listen as much of as I could in one place. This idea sprang to my mind when I was  skimming through Beatport and noticed that DJ Zinc had released his seminal proto-grime/proto-dubstep track “138 Trek” (from 2000) in digital format on streaming platforms, as well as all the stuff from his Bingo Beats label. And shortly after, I realized that Locked On, an influential proto-dubstep label coming from a UK Garage standpoint, had also made its releases from the early 2000s available for streaming.\n\nDubstep didn't come out of a vacuum. In my [Dubstep Allstars retrospective](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181124_a-look-back-dubstep-allstars-a-movement-takes-shape), I wrote about the two DJs, Hatcha and Youngsta, who were the most influential in shaping the South London sound of “140bpm bass music”, that we know as old school dubstep. However, from 2000 (ish) to 2004, there was a whole scene around them (however small it was in the grand scheme of things). The established grand narrative of dubstep would have you think that, before 2004,  everyone was playing the same tracks from the same people (namely El-B, Horsepower Productions, Zed Bias, Skream, Benga, Artwork). But that is an incomplete story of dubstep's origins. (the complete story is beyond the scope of this entry and my knowledge)\n\nNow, I wasn't there, so both my knowledge and my selection for this playlist are strictly based on old sets, nostalgia sets, interviews and blog posts. The important thing to understand is that, like the beginning of every genre, there wasn't yet a clear-cut, defined “genre”. FWD's mission wasn't to invent a new one either; it was simply to promote underground club music. In this case, due to the era in which it started, that largely meant underground 2-step/UK Garage. But there we only so many garage tracks that fit the criteria. So DJs had to get creative with their selection, look outside of the genre to find tracks that would fit with the club night's overall vibe. Look into future jazz, broken beat techno, breaks, and maybe some electro; and even 8-bar and eski beat – both being early iterations of grime. And the sound progressed, incubating within this small scene, with all of those sounds being part of its DNA. As it went along, there was a focus on making it \"darker\".\n\nAt the end of the day, it was about playing “deep” sounds. Informed by “garridge music”, but not strictly “garridge”. Deep sounds, as opposed to the poppier vibe that the genre had been shifting into, like Wookie and Selena's syrupy strings in “[Give it Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiO53Cvjro)”, MJ Cole's soul-tinged “[Sincere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02KRAshCG0w)” and So Solid Crew's bling-bling style with their “[Sentimental Things (Oh No)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guJ0NyQVs9I)”.\n\nCompare those with Marcus Intalex and ST Files's “Taking Over Me”, which initiates the playlist. It's a house track, through and through, but its rollings breaks and atmospheric synths were a great fit for FWD, something that, for example, Blackdown would use to pad out his sets (as he explains in this great[ blog post](http://blackdownsoundboy.blogspot.com/2018/12/roots-of-reflections.html)).\n\nThe obvious players are almost all here (again, those whose music is available to stream): El-B, Zed Bias (Phturistix, Maddslinky, E.S. Dubs) and Horsepower Productions. But let's not forget the ultra-minimalist and raw 8-bar sounds of Big$hot, Youngstar and Corporation of London, whose beats were made for MCs but that could blend well with Horsepower Productions' “tribal garage” (“Fat Larry's Skank”) or Zed Bias' heavy fusion of future jazz and garage (e.g. “Reject”, \"551 Blues\"). Let's also not forget Ms Dynamite's bashment/garage collabs with Oris Jay/Darwqwan (“Test Dis”), Menta (“Ramp”) or Sticky (Booo!) that could go well beside Nubian Mindz' heavy broken beat techno, or beside DJ Zinc/Jammin's brand of “breakstep” that he pushed with his Bingo Beats label. Etc, Etc,.\n\n There are some glaring holes though. Tempa hasn't made most of its pre-2005 backlog available for streaming, and neither have its affiliated labels (ShelfLife, Soulja and Road). Big Apple Records, another influential South London label, which promoted Skream, Benga, Loefah, and the Digital Mystikz, has closed shop a while ago and their releases have remained vinyl-only. Also missing for streaming are the releases from Texture Records, which focused on the “breaks” side of the “140 scene”, and became more aggro as it went on. Finally, all of the early white-label grime releases are obviously missing, notably the material from Jon E Cash and DJ Wonder whose approach with skeletal production and sub-bass overload very much informed what became \"dubstep\".\n\nNevertheless, the 60+ tracks I've compiled (taken from various re-releases and compilations) should give you a pretty good idea of where the genre came from, _sonically_. One last thing I'd like to point out regarding the playlist: the last six tracks are “proper dubstep”, ranging from 2004 to 2008. These were selected to include the five South London producers who were the favourites of Hatcha and Younga (D1, Loefah, Mala, Benga, Coki) and also to have different styles, which is why I chose Distance's “Tropical Rub”, whose aggro vibe is a precursor to what would become the “brostep” sound (that “filthy”, aggressive, wub wub, “drop it like a B0:55” style that became popular around the world in the early 2010s). We have Loefah's dread-filled beats, Mala's meditative dub-rasta deepness, Benga and Coki's preference for more bouncy, ravey riddims, and, lastly, Skream's “Hedd Banger” which showcases the classic, dark and deep halfstep style. The 62 preceding tracks should let you be able to further contextualize them musically.\n\n_I've assembled the tracks in chronological order, then organized them in alphabetical order (according to artist names) within their year of release. This was done to make it much simpler for me, so there's no “flow” that I tried to establish. At 6+ hours, this isn't really a playlist that you'd listen in one sitting. Whether you want to skim through it or listen in multiple sessions, is up to each listener, obviously._\n\n[SPOTIFY PLAYLIST LINK](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AIeV1cAXEgG06uclrjJ3V)\n\n[GOOGLE PLAYLIST LINK](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXylEBAUu0Rl4TVzG75VzPKEWCCewMV4E2SiE-NdwvHe5L4RLqRus9QLgZRQiqjU01RbXoHED4zZPHLbwCeRQzLmGLo6MOw%3D%3D)\n\nTracklist:\n\n2000\n\nMarcus Intalex + S.T.

Actually, why shouldn't there be? I don't know how many hours of DJs sets and mixes are uploaded every week (or day), but at this point, it has to be a huge fucking number. So I thought I'd make a list of the things I've enjoyed, to give people a glimpse into what is worth their time (I hope).\n\nI don't know if I'm going to make a regular series out of this. Like a lot of things on this blog, I partly do it for myself. In this case, I'd though I'd do a quick look-back at the month of January, in terms of the mixes that have left an immediate impression. If I'm to make a year-end list like I did with 2018, then this initiative also makes the final choosing process a lot easier. Yet, as a digger, I'll probably stumble upon something that I somehow missed and that, yes, probably should have been here. Doesn't matter. This is what I've enjoyed the most from January, as of now. It's a pretty solid list.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Truancy Volume 233: Peverelist\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/564031296&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nI've already expressed my [great appreciation](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181104_peverelist-s-bass-music-jungle-re-contextualized) for Peverelist's work, so I don't think I'll indulge into praising the man once more. What I will say is that if, like myself, you've never had to opportunity to catch him live (as he rarely ventures out of the UK and Europe), then he's offered a great sneak peak into what his “club-oriented” sets sound like. If you've been tuning into his monthly Livity Sound show on NTS Radio, and if you've listened to the mixes he's released online for the last decade, then you' know that he likes to keeps things “dubby”, “chilled-out”, only intensifying the energy momentarily. This mix starts out that way but quickly shifts into a skanking, percussive, bassy affair, sometimes hinging close to the Hard Drum vibe. A real treat from the legendary Bristol DJ, producer and label head.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Strategy (100% Strategy productions) DJ set | Keep Hush Manchester: Strategy presents\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lsmy8UD-i1U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nI honestly don't know much about Strategy, other than the fact that he's released a DnB record on Exit last year. What drew me to listen to this set was actually Chunky's presence as the host MC. Remember Chunky? Lately, he's been doing his thing with a Manchester-based Hip Hop collective, but back in the early years of this decade, he was the voice of Swamp 81 (when it was one of the coolest and most influential labels in UK underground club music), donning the mic, with Loefah on the decks spinning some spaced-out Electro and Techno. In recent years, due to changing tastes, I feel as if MCs in UK club music have largely been pushed to the margins. Chuncky has also dropped out of the Swamp 81 crew, so it's great to hear his voice again. But I also enjoyed the music itself here. Composed entirely of his own (unreleased) productions, Strategy dips into the 124 bpm territory, venturing into rude House and Funky rhythms, deep UK Techno and halftime beats à la Dubstep.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"The Heatwave - King Tubby Special - 30th January 2019\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fthe-heatwave-30th-january-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nAlong with David “Ram Jam” Rodigan, Gabriel Heatwave's selection is responsible for my appreciation of Dancehall and all things Reggae. He used to have a weekly show on Rinse FM a few years ago, but lately he's been focused on his Hot Wuk live shows and getting back into production, bringing him to only do monthly shows for both Rinse and NTS. In this month's episode for NTS, he commemorates the work and influence of King Tubby on the week of the 30th anniversary of his murder in Jamaica. Offering one hour of King Tubby-produced songs (mostly Roots and Dub), Gabriel Heatwave briefly explains his influence on the concept of the “remix” and of “producing for MCs” (as opposed to singers). A great listen.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf: 11th January '19 - Noods Radio\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fhenry-greenleaf-11th-january-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nHenry Greenleaf made a appearance in my previous list. As I've stated, he started out as a DnB producer but has made the transition into the UK Techno scene. In this set for Noods Radio, the music is like Greenleaf's own production: weighty, direct, sparse but energetic, and owes to old school Dubstep and Drum n Bass as much as it does to Berlin Techno. What we get here is 2 hours of rolling beats ranging from the dark and minimal to the upbeat and melodic, with quite a handful of dubplates for good measure.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Akito w/ Yetsuby - 11th January 2019 - NTS Radio\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fakito-11th-january-20191%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nThe Sans Absence label boss consistently starts off the new year in a great way with this set for NTS Radio. Also making a second appearance in my lists, he continues with the tribal and funky side of Hard Drum. His guest DJ from South Korea, Yetsuby, takes over for the second half. While her selection doesn't have the strong tribal and percussive leanings of Akito, she hones in on the current UK sound of bass music, packing in a cohesive and diversified set of beats. I didn't know her at all before listening to this show, but I've got to look her stuff up now.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Reclaim Your City - 12 Janvier 2019 - Rinse France\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FRinseFrance%2Freclaim-your-city-12-janvier-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nI came across these guys through some of my favourite producers and DJs who have made guest mixes for this show. Admittedly, I don't really know anything about them, other than the fact that it's a label of the same name which focuses on “the best underground techno from around the globe \". I'm not nearly into the current, “conventional” side of Techno as I was once, but what I love about these guys is that they stay on top of things in the Techno world, and every week on Rinse France they present their own “best of” from what the genre currently has to offer. The last third of this 2-hour show strays into more experimental and leftfield territory, adding a refreshing palette to your typical 4/4 straight Techno. And their sequencing and seamless blends keep things engaging.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Keysound - 24th January 2019 - Rinse FM\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/564396774&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nUK Bass, UK Techno, 130 Sound, whatever it's called -  for the last few years, the main cyber-exporter of this music has been the Keysound show on Rinse FM, with listeners from all over the world (especially the States) locking in to hear what it has to offer that is both fresh and exciting. The show is named after the record label run by Blackdown and Dusk, who became active in the UK underground club scene way back when Dubstep was still in its initial stages and didn't yet have an official name. Blackdown actually runs a [blog](http://blackdownsoundboy.blogspot.com/), which, although currently only semi-active, became an important and influential space in which he could commentate on the nascent scene of Dubstep. Now, as they did back then, they focus on the “new”. At around the end of the first hour, they slip in a few El-B tracks, and Blackdown (I think) remarks: “_His music is why I started to produce music of my own in the first place_”. El-B's work is considered as being a fundamental building block of Dubstep, but this set also demonstrate how the new stuff stills owes a lot to it. El-B's style of UK Garage – infectious grooves, swaggering syncopation, dark atmospherics and bouncy subbass – weaves itself seamlessly into the fresh sounds. \n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kaizen w/ Madam X & AQXDM - 31st January 2019 - NTS  Radio\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fkaizen-31st-january-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nAlong with Keysound's show on Rinse Fm, Madam X' monthly Kaizen show on NTS Radio has become a must-listen for fans wishing to get a taste of the bassy UK Techno that she's been pushing for many years now, as a DJ and label boss. And while it is true that she's been including more conventional 4/4 warehouse techno and jacking House beats into her sets (in part, probably taking away from what made her unique in the global scene), it hasn't taken away from the strength of her selection (she also seems to have the pull to get unreleased exclusive material from UK bass/techno producers), and, mainly, from her innate talent in blending and sequencing the tracks. When she's on, the music becomes more riveting and powerful, sometimes even if you've already heard the tracks before to lesser effect. It's why she's become an underground club hero in the UK scene. She's joined on the second hour by a guest mix from AQXDM – duo composed of  Deapmash, and Toronto-native and Berlin-based Aquarian -  who also delve into the weighty sounds of UK Techno.","name":"20190206_its-all-about-the-echo-chamber-january-mixes","urlPath":"/article/20190206_its-all-about-the-echo-chamber-january-mixes"},{"publicationDate":"Dec 06, 2018","title":"The New Hardcore - Part Deux","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/hardcorep2.png","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"Another year has passed. Instead of making of list of albums, I thought I'd switch things up a little and make a list of mixes centered on the \"new Hardcore\".","body":"As we reach the end of another year, and with just under a month left until the  31st, the bombardment of end-year lists throughout the whole sphere of music journalism has already begun. Journalists and critics are expected to do so, as the eagerly awaiting music geeks look for what the past 12 months had the best to offer according to these authoritative voices, who in turn will be personally insulted or praised, and whose opinions will be vehemently dismissed or maybe even given approbation. Putting together these year-end lists is a great way to reflect about the music we have enjoyed throughout the year, about why we enjoy them, and what they mean to us or what they mean in the grander scheme of things.\n\nIn one of my most recent articles, in which I shared a mix of \"new school\" old school Hardcore, I reflected about the revivalism of Hardcore from these last couple of years, about the paradox of _reviving and imitating the sound of a past scene that sought to innovate and which looked towards the future_. And I said that we should try to imitate the spirit of Hardcore instead of copying its plasticity (ie its sonic palette ). The essence of Hardcore, the clash between electronic music and Jamaican sound system culture, boils down to these things, in my opinion: the constant search for the new, musical hybridity, and _rudeness _(beats that focus on the groove, drums and subbass, with a sense of _rudebwoy _swagger).\n\nSo, with end of the year 2018 in sight, I thought I'd make a list of some of my favourite mixes and sets that reflect on what the Hardcore sound _currently _is. When it comes to electronic music, all of these end-year lists by music publications have one fault, in that they focus largely on the traditional rockist formats of albums and EPs (Hip Hop mixtapes too, since they adhere to this traditional presentation). If mixes are included, they are usually official releases from the bigger labels (eg the Fabric series, the Berghain series, etc). Club/Rave music (including Hardcore, of course) is anything but traditional.\n\nWhile the rockist tradition instills all of the praise on the producer, it omits the fact that the DJ is the driving force of this music. The mix is its beating heart. The mix is why the producer makes the music to begin with. The Hardcore culture's soul can be found at the club, online radio sets and podcasts (or on pirate radio if we go back 20 years). Because of the fact that these venues are unofficial, underground and more relaxed, they encourage spontaneity and maybe even the inclusion of remixes that might be insanely difficult or too costly to clear for official mix CDs. After about eight years of listening to electronic music, I finally understand that.\n\nSo let's get on with the list!\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Batu - Live @ P13 x Timedance 24.02.18\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/416037318&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nAt the start of this year, I felt as if everything was kind of a mess. Not that it actually was, but I felt as though the underground scene of UK bass music was so wide, comprised of various micro-scenes that formed as quickly as they dissolved, as to be confusing and impenetrable. Because of the Internet, the \"UK\" sound isn't just in the UK anymore, as artists from the US, Canada, Mexico, France, and Australia gravitate towards the UK's particular vibe, if you will. And I couldn't make sense of it. But Bristol's Batu made it make sense.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, he graced us with this live recording of his set from a club night organized by the Timedance label. Through his careful selection, this mix goes from Techno, to rhythmic Dub Techno, to Tribal-like and Vogue beats, to Gqom, to Breakbeat Techno and other bass and drum heavy genreless, leftfield _riddims_. Yet it stays cohesive. And it shows how all of this current UK (and UK-influenced) bass music is sort of _the same thing_, in that, yes, people are bringing their own styles to the table, but there's a similar thread through it all, because almost everyone shares the same, or similar, musical influences, staying between 120 and 130 bpm. In fact, I believe that we might be in a similar context to, say, 2002-2004, when Dubstep and Grime were taking shape within the same equally confusing musical diaspora of UK Garage offshoots (I talk about this in an [early article](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_uk-techno-bass-percussion-bass-hard-drums-the-new-hardcore)).Will new genres subsequently emerge? Who knows.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"NKC - 100% NKC Productions Mix for NoFile on Noods Radio - 22nd September 2018\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/505642275&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\nThis is the year in which I also began to appreciate a new sound, related to the UK Techno sound that Batu brings in the above mix - Hard Drum. This mix, a 100% Productions mix from NKC for his show on Bristol's Noods Radio, is the one responsible for this new found appreciation. Hard Drum, as the name implies, is anything but subtle.  It's hot and heavy underground sound system music with prominent percussion, using Afro-ish, wooden percussion. The most prominent influences are UK Funky, Tribal House and Gqom, with some Techno and American bass music sprinkled on there. Imagine futuristic, techy, metallic, bass-heavy Soca and Samba Carnival instrumentals.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Akito - 2nd November 2018 (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fakito-2nd-november-2018%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\nLondon's Akito is another practitioner of Hard Drum. And only since recently. Head of the Sans Absence label, he began focusing on UK Funky sounds, but has gradually shifted towards this current sound, somewhat confirming the lineage between UK Funky and Hard Drum. I was going to include one of his previous sets from his show on NTS Radio, but this one had to take its place after my first listen. Both selection and mixing are on point, as he offers an hour-long assault of percussive bass music.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"RNBWS - Resonance #130 (10.02.2018)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/399447219&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nI first came across RNBWS (pronounced \"rainbows\"), a Moscow-based DJ and producer, listening to his [great EP](https://soundcloud.com/bunkaudio/sets/rnbws-apnoea-bunk011) on the Manchester-based label, Bunk Audio. Although he himself is based in Russia, his sound is unmistakably UK-inspired. Like NKC, he offers a mix composed entirely of his own productions for the Resonance Moscow radio station. The sound? - UK Techno à la Batu: Stripped back Electro-influenced, syncopated beats and muscular 4x4 Techno backed up by a heavy sine wave bass.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kamikaze Space Programme - TNDB-podcast 04\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/463401891&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nKamikaze Space Programme has his origins in Drum n Bass under the Raiden name. In the early part of this decade, his interests turned to Techno, making a brand of bass-heavy Techno that used his same sonic palette from his DnB days, giving it an Industrial-like vibe, at times. This particular mix sees him interchange between dubby, stripped-back UK Techno (à la Livity Sound and Timedance) to harder, Industrial Techno, with lots of beats using distorted percussion. \n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf - Reprezent Radio Takeover\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/528774642&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n_\\*his set starts at around 1:06:00_\n\nAnother DnB alumni that has found himself in the deeper ends of today's UK Techno scene. Henry Greenleaf's own production takes much influence from the more recent Swamp 81 sound: stripped back, space and bass _riddims _that recall early Dubstep. This mix, composed entirely of unreleased dubplates from various producers, takes a more _percussively _livelier route by its 2nd half, and shows how seemingly disparate styles going on now actually fit together\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Slimzee vs. Boylan - 1st July 2018 (Rinse FM)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/466021572&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nLet's go into the 140 bpm realm with a back 2 back set by Slimzee and Boylan for Rinse FM. As early as 2001-2, Slimzee's selection of underground, raw, aggressive UK Garage  beats with the Pay As U Go Cartel massively helped define what would be known as Grime. By the mid 2000s, however, seeing the Grime scene become almost entirely MC-centric, he laid low until making his comeback behind the decks some five years ago now. This set, with new player Boylan, is comprised of more ravey Grime beats that don't necessarily cater to MCs. On the Grime subreddit, I read someone describe Slimzee's current selection as \"_anxiety inducing_\". Take note, the beats in this set can be intense.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Bell Curve - Footwoork Jungle Mix Series 054\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/538836972&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nLet's speed things up a little more.  New York's Bell Curve serves up a great mix of high velocity bass music for The Footwork Jungle. Like the A.Fruit mix that I shared in my DnB and Jungle post, her sound can't be honed into one specific genre, typical in the current era of open-ended music tastes and \"anything goes\" approach. But it all holds together, as she takes us from one futuristic _riddim _to another, going into old school-inspired sounds from time to time. Great things are happening in the Jungle/DnB space right now and this mix is a further testament to that.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Vromm - CBR Podcast 03\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/461353497&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nVromm's entry for the Cosmic Bridge podcast makes a second appearance into one of my playlists. I had to include it here. Released earlier in the year, this mix, along with the **Street Beats Vol. 2** compilation, gave me a rekindled interest in DnB. The vibe of this music presented here gives off a Dreamscape vibe, from the early to mid 90s, but it stays entirely modern and sounds \"current\", if you will, making use of more modern approaches to beat patterns (ie the halftime beat).\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Patrick Flint - Mix for Elise (Rinse France)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/522131337&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd to finish this list, another recent find, both the mix and the artist. In Patrick Flint's \"[Lean In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wr711NIZdA)\", I heard one of my favourite UK Techno tracks of the year. As that particular one would suggest, the mix mostly stays in the more dubbier end of current UK Techno (think of the recent releases from Livity Sound) but ramps up considerably in energy as it nears the end. Lots of great subbass heavy, syncopated beats are found here.","name":"20181206_the-new-hardcore-part-deux","urlPath":"/article/20181206_the-new-hardcore-part-deux"},{"publicationDate":"Nov 06, 2018","title":"My Favourite Unreleased Old-School Dubstep Tracks.","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/dubplate.jpg","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"Numerous quality tunes from Dubstep's early era never saw a release, but they live on in archived sets and Youtube rips. I list some of my favourites.","body":"Coming off from my last article about the first two Dubstep Allstars entries, I thought I would share some of my favourite unreleased tracks from the early Dubstep era, tracks that I still go back to. Most of these I heard listening to sets from the likes of Youngsta, Hatcha (our two protagonists from my last article), and also DJ Chefal, Cyrus, Slaughter Mob, etc. \n\nFor better or for worse, an important part of Dubstep is the dubplate culture it inherited from Jungle and DnB (who, in their turn, took it from the Jamaican soundsystem tradition). Briefly put, dubplates are unreleased tracks pressed on 10-inch records, not for commercial release, but for producers to hand out to DJs as exclusives, sometimes only making a couple of copies. This practice was encouraged by two things: 1) DJs trying to \"one-up\" their peers and competitors; and 2) the constant search for the new by DJs and ravers/listeners alike. Alex Nagshineh further explains what dubplate culture is in this [article](http://www.bonafidemag.com/dreams-rendered-metal-dubplate-culture/).\n\nSo let's get right to the list. As they are unreleased tracks, all of these have been ripped straight from archived radio sets. So you'll hear voices of MCs or DJs interacting with the listeners. The last track, the Digital Mystikz remix, is probably the ultimate dubplate, of which there are only two copies (one owned by Mala himself, and the other by Joe Nice). It is the Holy Grail of dubplates, if you will.\n\nThe producers making up this list (Skream, Benga, Loefah, Mala, Coki, D1) are the main producers that shaped the \"Croydon Sound\"(in turn, shaping what we now recognize as being \"Dubstep\") making these beats mainly for Hatcha and Youngsta. To my knowledge, they date from 2003 to 2006.\n\n## Skream - Boks\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Skream - Boks\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WTdFt_O803E\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## Benga - Amnesia\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Benga - Amnesia\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RX-a4ZeC4ag\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## Loefah - Gandhi\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Loefah - Gandhi\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IBWIdn40vC4\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## Loefah - Babylon\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Loefah - Babylon\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6eMxfyUoxo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## D1 - \\[Untitled Dubplate]\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"D1 - [Untitled Dubplate]\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CElko-ab4HM\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## D1 - Enigma\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"D1 - Enigma\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KT_h_nb30Vg\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## D1 - Degrees VIP\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"D1 - Degrees VIP\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftdhf-wgwEc\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## D1 - \\[Unknown Dubplate]\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"D1 - [Unknown Dubplate]\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZqyKH8Pe4o\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## Mala - Tiger Dance\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Mala - Tiger Dance\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbt5fYCEPi8\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## Coki - Crystal Lake\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Coki - Crystal Lake\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uv1WF0FRpSU\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n## The Mighty Zulu Nation - Justice Day (Digital Mystikz Dubplate Remix) aka DMZ vs MZN\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DMZ vs MZN\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hr8-jXZgsa4\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />","name":"20181124_my-favourite-unreleased-old-school-dubstep-tracks","urlPath":"/article/20181124_my-favourite-unreleased-old-school-dubstep-tracks"},{"publicationDate":"Sep 18, 2018","title":"Don Robbie's Crucial Past: Sniffing Our Way Into UK Reggae.","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/robbie.jpg","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"We should have known that Don Robbie from AFTV was a real badman. His days as the Crucial Robbie reminds us that the UK has had a rich Reggae scene for a while.","body":"As with many people who follow the Premier League, Arsenal's disappointing last four seasons have led me to discover AFTV (previously Arsenal Fan TV). Set up by Robbie Lyle in 2012, \"for the fans by the fans\", AFTV's intention was to give a venue where the disgruntled fans could speak their minds, ranting about the manager Arsène Wenger and his antiquated tactics, and the inconsistent showing from the players. The prestigious team's downward slope culminated last year with their 6th placed finish (they usually finish in the coveted top 4) and trophy-less season; their worst result in the 22 years that Wenger coached Arsenal, seeing him end his gig at the London club.\n\nIn all the highs and lows of the team, after every single game, week in and week out, whether they're playing in their home-base of North London or someplace in the Ukraine you never knew existed, Robbie shows up with his camera and his microphone at hand to interview the fans and let them express their elated joy or their continued despair.\n\nAnd for better or for worse, some charismatic interviewees became regulars on the channel; ordinary folks ranting about their team and manager, sometimes in an unintended comical fashion as with Troopz (the channel's nickname is BludFamTV because of his rants). These rants have attracted people from all over, transcending the Arsenal fanbase, to savour the _schadenfreude _or to simply be entertained.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"AFTV - Best of Troopz and DT\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQkzXNrPyTU?start=58\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nAnd Robbie is always there to document it. Not only those \"characters\", but also to get the opinion of other \"more sensible, reasonable\" fans. His work has earned him over 800k subscribers, making his channel by far the biggest football/soccer fan channel on Youtube. It has recently caught the attention of professional pundits and he's been invited to talk on TV and on other Youtube channels.\n\nAnd if the Youtube comment sections are to be believed, Robbie, racking in the money after every loss because of the funnier interviews which generate more views, owns everything now. Every stadium, every building, every parc, every monument (from whichever country) that are used as backdrops for his videos are apparently his. Really, it's just a playful way to express how much success he's had. That's why he's the Don. Don Robbie.\n\nHowever, about a year ago, someone unearthed some old concert footage featuring a familiar face. Well, it appears that before Don Robbie, in his days of yore, he was the reggae artist, the badman, the rudebwoy, the sound murderer, **Crucial Robbie**.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Crucial Robbie - Don't Sniff the Coke (Live)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDonpQ4tUkM\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />} />\n\nAnd to my, and certainly others', great delight, I found out that he had released an LP of Digi Reggae, _Crucial View_, released way back in 1990. While it's lacking his rediscovered hit,[ Don't Sniff the Coke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAUpBMG1iPA) (\\*sniff, sniff\\*), the album is a pretty solid work from the Casio keyboard-era of Dancehall.\n\nSo, if you're up for it, I feel that we could take this opportunity to dig a little further into UK Reggae. We've heard the Don in action on the mic, so let's have a look at other artists. I won't pretend to be an expert, but I thought I'd share some tunes I've enjoyed and discovered while listening to some of The Heatwave's and the Toast Collective radio shows. Don Robbie clearly says not to sniff the coke, so we won't. But I think we should take strong sniffs into UK Reggae. Robbie sniffs six times in his chorus. So we'll also take six sniffs. One song per sniff. Six sniffs. Six Songs.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n_\\*sniff\\*\n_\n\nOur first hit will be a dose of the UK Apachi's **No Poll Tax**. Yes, this is _the _Apachi, who would become the Ragga Jungle hero. Released in 1990 on Sweet Freedom Records.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"UK Apachi - No Poll Tax\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ApMttEqX0EE\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n\\*sniff\\*\n\nOur second hit is courtesy of another Jungle legend. Prior to his raving days, General Levy also dabbled in Dancehall. His 1988 track, **New Cockatoo**, already displays his unique vocal delivery that would make him popular.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"General Levy - New Cockatoo\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jK7CIE5VeA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n_\\*sniff\\*\n_\n\nThe third hit gives a taste of Top Cat's** Push Up Yu Lighter**. The 1992 track seems to be a flip of the mega-hit \"Under Mi Sleng Teng\" riddim.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Top Cat - Push Up Yu Lighter\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zz_CN-PNhzg\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n_\\*SNIFFFFF\\*\n_\n\nOur fourth hit is a strong one, fast-forwarding us all the way to the late 2000s. Producer DJ NG teams up with MC Versatile and future UK star and rave queen Katy B, in one of her first records. **Tell Me**, blending UK Garage with Carribean rhythms, is not only one of Katy B's best performances, but it was also very influential in shaping the UK Funky genre.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ NG feat Katy B & Versatile - Tell Me\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7tKPPsXawA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n_\\*sniff\\*\n_\n\nOur penultimate hit takes us to Lea-Anna. The forgotten UK singer brought us one of the biggest dancehall hits of 2012 with **Murder**.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Lea-Anna - Murder\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2VsDPs61aw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n\\*sniffffff\\*\n\nFinally, our last hit will be Stefflon Don's Afroswing track,** Envy Us**. Taking rhythm inspiration from the Afrobeats genre, the song is a great showcase as to why she's become one of the biggest UK Dancehall perfomers as of late.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Stefflon Don feat.

No. Ragga Song Spesh","mainImage":"/cms-content/uploads/ragga.jpg","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"The Ragga Ragga Ragga compilation series sadly ended four years ago. So let's make our own playlist of heavy hitters. Big sounds for big speakers.","body":"This year marks the 25th anniversary of VP Records' flagship _Reggae Gold_ series. While compilations of already-released, recent music seem like an antiquated idea, I think it actually suits genres like Dancehall and Reggae, where so much music is released every year, and where so much of it can, in honesty, be discarded. Sure, the same can be said for probably most genres, but the Dancehall scene has the tendency to churn out a ridiculous amount of music, more so than in any other genre I've encountered. And for a genre that has always been singles-focused (more so in the last 20 years), a compilation can serve as an entry point into what people are listening, and as an introduction to new names in the scene that one might have missed. VP Records are not only an influential label, but they're also regarded as fine selectors.\n\nNow, maybe's it's because I'm beginning to be out of touch with the current tastes in the Reggae world, but I felt like this year's _Reggae Gold_ entry to be underwhelming. Though, it's not without its high points. **Hoodcelebrityy**'s hit, \"Walking Trophy\", is as catchy and charming as it is earnest. And so is **Dovey Magnum**'s \"Bawl Out\" (although in a more hyper-sexual manner). **Estelle's \"**Better\" is as good as any modern R'n'B number from the likes of Rihanna, Drake, or any of your favourite US-based artists. And lastly, **Shenseea**'s \"Nothing Dem Nuh Have Ova Me\" is a perfect example of why she's one of my favourite current singers in Dancehall.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Dovey Magnum - Bawl Out\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUH5OhAQhmQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\nI feel like the rest of the release is filled with mediocre Roots Reggae and Pop Reggae fluff. A problem with modern Dancehall is in how much a lot of it has crossover'd with Mainstream/US Pop music. I don't remember on which forum or Youtube comment section I saw this, but I recall seeing Dancehall being described as \"turning into pop music with patois accents\". I won't dare to dictate what Jamaican music should be like, nor will I pretend to be an expert (I can only share my own tastes), but I do somewhat agree with that sentiment, in that it expresses a loss of modern Dancehall's \"uniqueness\", or \"Jamaican character\", at least when it comes to instrumentation.\n\nFor the most part, this 25th anniversary entry does not disprove that. I understand that Jamaican music has always had an extremely close relationship with American Rnb (and Hip Hop) music throughout the decades, but some Dancehall artists' (especially producers) mainstream aspirations bring them to imitate their American counterparts too closely, instead of innovating and coming up with new sounds of their own.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\nBut don't get it twisted, Dancehall still has a lot to offer. To say the contrary would be too narrow-minded. And, to be honest, most of Dancehall still sounds, to my ears, characteristically \"Jamaican\", taking cues from all kinds of modern music, but still following in the footsteps of King Jammy, Rude Boy Kelly, and the like. And so, _\"why not make a Dancehall playlist/compilation that I'd want to listen?_\", I asked myself. And I did.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Terror Fabulous - Ya Nah Kotch (Pepper Seed Riddim)\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5WWCGDgkaCw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n_Ragga Ragga Ragga_, the other big compilation series, saw its last entry in 2014. Disappointing, since it was my favourite series of the two. It focused more on the \"sound system\"/ club side of Dancehall, and did away with the cheesy modern Roots stuff that _Reggae Gold_ will sometimes include. So that's exactly what I will do. A playlist of back to back sound system business, that I'll name, the _Ragga Song Spesh 2018:_\n\n1. _Stylo G - Yu Zimme_\n2. _K More - Washing Machine_\n3. _Ishawna - Mi Belly \\[Under Wata Riddim]_\n4. _Mavado - Enemies_\n5. _Shenseea - Position \\[Bashment Time Riddim]_\n6. _Charly Black - Tan Tuddy \\[Bashment Time Riddim]_\n7. _Mr. Lexx - More Than You \\[Boom Riddim]_\n8. _Ce'Cile - Indie Gyal \\[Boom Riddim]_\n9. _The Heatwave feat. Stylo G - Closer to Me_\n10. _Pamputtae - Champion Jockey \\[Champion Jockey Riddim]_\n11. _Danielle Di - Round A Back_\n12. _Stefflon Don - Senseless_\n13. _NSG feat. Geko - Yo Darlin'_\n14. _Konshens - Bassline_\n15. _Shenseea - Subrosa_\n16. _Shokryme - Selfish \\[Tropical Bounce Riddim]\n    _\n\nThe playlist includes tracks from 2017 and 2018. The cutoff point for last year's music is June, when_ Reggae Gold 2017 _came out, which is when _Ragga 2017 _would also have come out had it not been discontinued._ Ragga Song Spesh 2018_ _is my favourite Dancehall from that point to now.\n\nOne thing you might notice is the proliferation of UK-based artists: **Stylo G**, **K More**, **Stefflon Don**, **The Heatwave**, **NSG**. More could have been included, which is not surprising. I feel, through listening to internet radio, as if the UK (London, especially) has been a point of convergence for modern \"Afro\" music - Jamaica's Dancehall, West Africa's Afrobeats, London's own Afroswing and, to a certain extent, South Africa's Gqom - for some time now. Artists like Stylo G and The Heatwave are veterans at this point, the latter taking a crack at production again these last couple of years, creating one of the best Dem Bow tracks in his and Stylo G's \"Closer to Me\". NSG offers a taste of London in his Afroswing track, \"Yo Darlin'\". The rest ranges from 90s throwback stuff, to club jams, to slower tracks.\n\nSo get your _RSS _(_Ragga Song Spesh_) feed right here, through the embedded Youtube playlist, [**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/user/kardneegees/playlist/4eCCe1Bm7nWfDbLmkMws34), or [**Google Play**](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXynFqgC1zTC1kFgv7Cee6XpgaDWjEJeTbUaGsmf-pAKiKIdpjMkyJTdAM9JvRgBPECopIkHPlp8WcVOUMLWbm0HHI9LPyA%3D%3D).
